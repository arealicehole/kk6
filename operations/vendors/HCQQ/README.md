## COMMUNICATION HISTORY

### Discord Conversation - Nov 21, 2025

**HCQQ (4:09 PM):**
> "hey brotha! I was just wondering if I could do anything else for the event! It would be really dope to have some kind of display or signage for the company, there isn't much information in the secret prizes about where they're coming from 😅 but I also was wondering, I've been trying to sell / donate a good amount of webkinz stuffed animals I could probably ship out, would just need to figure out shipping costs."

**A Real Icehole (4:29 PM):**
> "Do you want to send signage or something? I'm down for whatever or if you got stickers or something like that. And I mean how much you think shipping will cost for those"

**HCQQ (5:46 PM):**
> "I don't actually have anything right now. I could manufacture something or possibly create signage and send you money to have it created locally to save shipping it. I kind of prioritized inventory and quality over some things you need for promotion 😅🥲. but i feel like I can definitely work something out. i'm just wondering about time frame.
>
> for the stuffed animals, there's just a lot of them. I could purchase a vacuum sealer and cut down on the shipping box size a lot but then there's the vacuum sealer cost. Which i would happily just buy to have on hand but im a bit at my limit currently and to be completely transparent, all of the promo and reposts from many big creators and offering up to 50% when my products are already 50% off only netted me one dm and that person didn't follow through 😅😂 that's business life tho i supposed. I have a big setup about to be ready because I insta bought the brand new bambu lab p2s model printer so I'll be able to create a lot of promo material via that. but that's essentially where I am at currently, full transparency."

**HCQQ (9:37 PM):**
> "I'll figure out some sort of signage and try to organize it being there in time. thanks."

**A Real Icehole (9:38 PM):**
> "how many of the toys we talkin that you would need a vacccum sealer?
> ive got connects on signage that i could get you rpetty cheap probably and it would be done in time for the event
> ngl ive been eyeballing a 3d printer too lol"

**HCQQ (9:42 PM):**
> "i think there's 10 of 11 of them tbh. but they're not super small. some are super puffy
> dude i'm really excited. i've done so much prep for it. should get it tomorrow ✊🏼"
