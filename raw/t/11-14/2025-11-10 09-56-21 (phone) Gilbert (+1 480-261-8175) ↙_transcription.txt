Speaker A: Yo, so I'm leaving the piano replacement now. Okay. She gave me her email because she was like, yo, I want to get. We got plenty of time. I want to get that details. Let's do something cool this year, okay? And then also I was like, how big of a pinata can we get? You know? She was like, I don't know. She was like, it's a some chicken Mexico. Like how big you want it, yo? Right. And I was like, I don't know, like, because the one big one she sells for like $50, right? And I was like, I don't know, like what about a hundred dollars? And she's like, a hundred dollars? Look, it feels like a life size pinata. I only need that much stuff to put in there, you know? Right. So. But I was gonna say with all that information I got the email, we should probably. I guess I'll just send her a picture of around ornament. We should figure out what kind of designs we want on it and we can send it out. I'll just send that out today. And then do we want our logo on it, right? Or do we want it to say like can of kick or how do you want to do that? It's whatever. All right, so then I guess I'll. Once I get the process, I'll send this email out there and then what else do you think? I decided here's probably some stuff because I really want to get these toy boxes out to the location. I mean, sooner we get the toy box and get into the teenagers right after location. Right. So you know, just weird stuff like that getting real antsy at the bit kind of deal. So I'm trying to do as much stuff as humanly possible. And we should at least get a flyer made or something ends today or video something. Right? Like a paid advertisement. Because now people need to the events going on. Right. So that's all I'm thinking about. I'm about ready to swoop on some food real quick. And then when I get the roses, I guess I'll call you back and then think of anything else you can try to get me to do. Okay, team. Team can recruit. Break. Ready, Break. All right, peace out.
