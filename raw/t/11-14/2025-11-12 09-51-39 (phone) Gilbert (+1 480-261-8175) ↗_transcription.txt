Speaker B: No, I like the lazy one executive.
Speaker A: Summary the 2025 Head Prohibition act this report provides a comprehensive legal and market analysis of the hemp regulating provisions contained in the federal government funding legislation passed in November 2025. This provision, identified as section 781 of the Agriculture Appropriations act, represents the most significant change to federal hemp law since the 2018 Farm Bill and is projected to effectively dismantle the $28 billion US hemp derived cannabinoid industry. The analysis confirms the following key findings in response to the stakeholder query the Legislative Vehicle the provision was not a standalone bill but a last minute eleventh hour rider inserted into the fiscal year 2026 Act. Agricultural, rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriation act this act was bundled into HR 5371, the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions act of 2026, a must pass minibus bill to end a 41 day government shutdown. The Political Context the provisions triggered a public intraparty conflict between Kentucky's Republican Senators. It was championed by Senator Mitch McConnell and vehemently opposed by Senator Rand Paul who argued it was extreme extraneous language that would eradicate the hemp industry. The Senators amendment or Senators Paul Amendment to strip section 781 from the bill was defeated by an overwhelming 76 to 24 vote. What is Banned the provision enacts a near total ban on the current consumable hemp market through a multi pronged redefinition of hemp new product cap. It imposed an exceptionally low limit of 0.4mg of total THC per container of all final hemp products. Industry analysts describe this limit as basically zero. This cap is projected to make over 90 to 95% of all hemp products, including non intoxicating full spectrum CBD oils. Illegal New Plant Definition it changes the legal THC limit for the plant from 0.3% Delta 9 THC to 0.3% total THC, a definition that includes THCA. This change specifically closes the THCA loophole that allowed for the sale of high THCA flower. New Synthetic Ban it explicitly banned synthetic and chemically converted cannabinoids such as Delta 8 THC derived from CBD. Verification on seeds the stakeholder information is correct. The new law extends complex restrictions to seeds, creating a distinction that did not previously exist in federal law. Hemp seeds are safe seeds for industrial application example grain fiber, oil, animal feed and viable seeds for planting. Only industrial use crops are explicitly protected in a new industrial hemp safe harbor definition. Cannabis seeds Banned the new law excludes any viable seed from a plant that exceeds a total tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of 0.3%. This means that seeds will grow a hot plant, ie high thc. Marijuana plants are now unambiguously federally illegal, removing the legal gray area market for their sale. Implementation the ban is not immediate. The legislation includes a one year grace period or one year fuse from the date of enactment, setting a deadline for the industry to comply, liquidate or seek a legislative reversal. The hemp ban was not the result of a standalone legislative debate such as a new farm bill, which would have involved extensive hearings and input from the agricultural communities. Instead, it was enacted using a procedural tactic known as an appropriations rider. The provision was inserted at the 11th hour into HR 5371, which is the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions act of 2026. The primary purpose of this legislation was to enact a protracted 41 day federal government shutdown that had began on October 1st. This made the bill a must pass legislation forcing lawmakers to vote on the entire package, including the hemp provision, to reopen the government. The hemp provision itself is identified as Section 781 of the bill, one of three full year fiscal 2026 appropriation bills bundled into the larger MIMBIS package Minibus package. The package was advanced by Republican leadership, including Mitch McConnell, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. The procedural contact is critical to understanding the outcome. By attaching the controversial non germane policy provision to a must pass bill, proponents forced a difficult vote. Senators were faced with a choice either accept the new law, the new hemp restrictions, or vote against reopening the federal government. This dynamic explains how Senator McConnell was able to win out over the objections of Senator Rand Paul and other senators who may have opposed the provisions on states rights grounds but ultimately voted for the larger package to end the shutdown. The inclusion of 781 created a rare situation that publicly pitted Paul against federal Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell. Both senators were instrumental in legalizing hemp in 2018, making their 2025 schism on the issue notable. Senator Paul's opposition was immediate and vocal. Rooted in economic and federal overreach. Paul argued that the provision was a direct attack on Kentucky farmers and and would harm Kentucky's hemp farmers and small businesses. He framed hemp as an economic lifeline and a new cash crop for farmers facing challenges in traditional commodity markets. Paul did not mince words on the provisions impact stating it will shut down the hemp industries across the United States in Florida remarks and public statements. He said the new limits would eradicate or destroy the entire $28 billion industry. Paul, along with Senator Ted Cruz argued that the one size fits all federal standard was enacted of overreach that overrides 23 state laws. He and other industry advocates contended that the states were already beginning to implement common sense regulations like age restrictions and labeling standards, and that this federal brand was unnecessary. Paul decried that the provision as extraneous language that has nothing to do with reopening the government. In terms of action, Senator Paul used his procedural right to drag out Senate passage by refusing to grant the expedited legislative procedures including needed for a quick vote. His goal is to force the vote on his amendment, which was a simple one page provision, to strike a provision modifying the definition of hemp also cited as an amendment to strike Section 781. He delivered remarks on the Senate floor on November 10th defending the industry. Senator Paul's effort ultimately failed. McConnell offered a motion to table the amendment. Oh, he actually is the one that motioned the table a parliamentary procedure to kill the amendment without a direct up or down vote on its merits. Senate vote to table Paul's amendment Oh, so they voted to table it. Right. And then they. So they didn't even vote on it. So nobody got to vote on it. They just said we're not going to vote on this. They voted to not vote the over. This overwhelming bipartisan vote against Senator Paul's position is highly significant. It demonstrates the formation of a powerful and unusual coalition aligned against the hemp industry. This coalition included social conservatives and prohibitionists, the alcohol industry lobby and the state licensed marijuana industry. The pincer movement Movement of moral health problems are moral and health proponents and two separate powerful commercial lobbies. Alcohol and marijuana combined with the must pass nature of the shutdown bill created an insurmountable political barrier that Senator Paul's defense of farmers and states rights could not overcome. The only Republican to vote with Paul to save the amendment were him and Senator Ted Cruz. Forensic analysis of the new federal hemp restrictions. I think we kind of went over that market, so that's pretty.
Speaker B: Mechanical. Burner is in chill. Want to jump in there? But. Yeah, no, that's beyond. I'll do that.
