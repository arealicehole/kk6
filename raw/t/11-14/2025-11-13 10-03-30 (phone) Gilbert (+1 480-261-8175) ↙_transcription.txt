Speaker B: Yo.
Speaker A: So I'm about to go deliver this, and then I'm gonna go get a couple boxes, and you need to check to see if you have wrapping paper.
Speaker B: All right?
Speaker A: And I'm coming your house, and we're gonna stream us making some boxes, and we're gonna do the first Hot Box podcast. Now, we're. What we're gonna do, though, is we're gonna do it on the way to drop off the boxes at Amaranth and Ginza. I have wrapping paper, I guess. Awesome.
Speaker B: I like it. Yeah, I'm not sure that was wrapping paper. I'll go ask my mom.
