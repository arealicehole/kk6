Speaker A: Calling. Good morning. Thank you for calling Sojourner Center. This is Jill. How may I help you?
Speaker B: Hi, Jill. My name is Frank. We have done Toy Drive independent of y' all for the last three years. And then we come and bring a bunch of toys.
Speaker A: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker B: Yeah. So we've done it the last three years. We want to do it again this year. But we want to know what your cutoff was for receiving the toys or.
Speaker A: Oh, that's. Yes, yes. That's important, because I know in the past, we have received things after the holiday store, you know, has closed. And unfortunately, sir, I don't have that information in front of me, but I'm going to give you the cell phone number for Berkeley. She's our assistant Director of Community engagement. She's works down at the donation center. That's where she's stationed. And she's. She knows it all. Okay. It all goes through her.
