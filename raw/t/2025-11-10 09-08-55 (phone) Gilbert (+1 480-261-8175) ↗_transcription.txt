Speaker A: Hey, what up? What's up? So I just was on chat. GPT. Right. Okay. And then I was going over, like, did you know how we were talking about harassing that area and, like, that retainer wall and stuff like that? Yes. The ordinance on if we needed permits or the threshold for us not needing permits, so. Because they're, like, really specific about, like. So it has to be, like, less than 10ft of filter. The retainer wall has to be less than 4ft tall. These are Canal county rules. Yeah. And it can. The terrace can't be more than 50 cubic feet. Oh, yeah. I'd ask. I'd get a second. Right. But yeah. No. So what I did is I asked it to pull the. Just pulled the specific legal documents that you're trying to reference that deal from the Pinal County. Mm. And instead it found these two documents. So that's when I hit you up, and I was like, all right, we should probably take these two documents and actually go through it in a more thorough fashion. So that was all I was trying. What do you got going today? Oh, yeah, no. So I'm going to the place right now and then. So we should make a little checklist and try to jam out as many doable things today as possible, because now we got the. We got the date set for the end of the toy drive. So now we just need to put that information out. Not the information, the emails that we whipped up. But I'm. I'm driving around right now. And then when I post it up, I'll give you a call. I'll see what we can figure out. But try to see if he can get those documents and put them into a. Or something. But I'll hit you up later. Okay. All right, peace.
