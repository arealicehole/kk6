UNKNOWN: You're on the way. Alright, so here's the thing. Tell me. We've bullshitted enough, Gilbert. You were trying to be on this yesterday, so I know you're already there. Let's go. What do you need? Just in general. So, uh, cat bees. That's the only way we're gonna pay for the motherfuckin' skunk sesh. Or for the kickback. And, uh, well, cat bees is, uh, I'm not going to the print shop. I've bullshitted too long. I'm gonna go pick up these prints that are ready for tomorrow. And then I'm gonna go later tonight and have adult activities. But, so I got till like 4, 5. Do shit. So, let's fuckin' do shit. And, uh, we need, uh, I was just talking to Greg just called me. And Greg is on my app now. And you know what he's on it about? Yeah. Which is fuckin' actually really good. Um, fuckin' Tana Crew ain't doin' enough. Yeah. With emails and online, social medias. And he calls them CRM, which is Customer Retention Model. And, uh, but pretty much just runnin' like a business. And, uh, and he's finally got it that the skunks and the can of crew are different. But he says the only way that they're different is what they're supposed to do. Not what they actually do. And, uh, so we need to do the things that we're supposed to do. Pretty much. Which is all the shit we always talk about. But, um, we're gonna have to pay for this kickback. Fuckin' heck. So, uh, you know, we gotta do that. So there's a couple ways that we're gonna get the money to do that. Um, one of them is nickel and dime these t-shirts. Because people have been fuckin' with them. Right? The big ones. However, uh, there is an issue. But, uh, workin' on the solution. And I think I got a flat tire. Uh, let's see. Let's drive a little bit. Um. But, uh, so. Nickel and dime t-shirts. Okay? And whatever little trapper-like things. Okay? There's potential to trap at, uh, I call it trappin'. But it's just spellin' our shit. At, like, a vendor spot. Like at an event in person. Um. We fuckin', uh. Uh. We gotta. Definitely, definitely gotta get on this content bullshit. Uh, with the documenting of the. Of the. Road to the shit. Um. And. Cat B events. If we can make, like, five hundred to a thousand dollars net on a little event and can do three, four of them in, you know, by October, we'll be in a good spot. Right? Yeah. If we can make five hundred bucks to a thousand dollars net on a Cat B, we can run a few of them and fuck around. Um. So, it's May. The middle of May right now. And, uh. So, we're already out of time. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So.
