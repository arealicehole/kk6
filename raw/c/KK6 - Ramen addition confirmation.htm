heres all the transcripts from today, i need you to read them and organize the info. kanna kickback is a main theme for the transcripts its was primarily a meeting for that. some of the stuff is like funny convos or whatever that are probably unrelated. other stuff is unrelated as well but could be lik e side stuff
Thought for 18s


            ChatGPT said:

Got ’em. I read through all eight transcripts and pulled out everything
useful for KK6. Here’s the organized digest you can act on right now.


  KK6 — Decisions, Plans, and To-Dos (Today’s Transcripts)


    Venue & Layout

  *

    *DJ & Stage:* Plan is DJ on the raised deck; consider moving some
    speaker gear to the dirt area for space and sightlines. KannaKlaus
    may mingle/MC from the same zone, but space is tight—test footprint.
    410716_0854_transcription

  *

    *Photo op with KannaKlaus:* Set up a dedicated chair + wrapped
    “gift” props and a big tree away from the DJ to avoid conflicts;
    manage a small line. 410716_0854_transcription

  *

    *Smoking zones:* No smoking in the patio/up on the deck; direct all
    smoking to the *dirt* area. Consider moving tables/activations there
    if needed. 410716_0854_transcription

  *

    *Vendor/Merch placement:* Trapper Dan merch + another vendor can
    share the long table; use racks/mannequin for display. Additional
    vendor row in the patio if middle furniture is cleared.
    410716_0854_transcription

  *

    *Power & Lighting:* Existing multicolor strings; add wraps around
    palms, plus reindeer/snowman props or big wrapped boxes. You’ll only
    get ~1 hour of darkness (event window ~2–6pm), so lighting is for
    mood + KannaKlaus photos/raffle moments. 410716_0854_transcription

  *

    *Mosquitoes/water feature:* Fountain nearby is drawing bugs—plan to
    treat/clean it before event. 410716_1028_transcription


    Charity / Boxes / Timeline

  *

    *Toy-drive kickoff:* Drop the *first donation box at the venue on
    Nov 1* as the public launch, then roll out additional boxes.
    410716_0854_transcription


    Entertainment & Giveaways

  *

    *Raffles/Prizes:* Target: *10 Chill bongs + 10 Special K* pieces for
    raffle (20 total), plus other adds (Eli, “cherry bomb”) as they come
    in. Display some glass on tables; if they “walk,” that’s okay—final
    raffle bundles at the end. 410716_0854_transcription

  *

    *DJ “Immersive”:* New DJ is confirmed tentatively (“good to go”);
    sent lighting examples from a recent tour. 410716_0854_transcription


    Food & Service Plan (Asian-fusion partner)

  *

    *Keep it fast & prep-friendly.* Prioritize dishes that can be
    batched or assembled quickly:

      o

        Entrees: *Orange chicken/beef, Teriyaki chicken/beef, Mongolian
        beef*, with *fried rice (pick your protein: shrimp/chicken/
        veg)*. Ramen optional but niche (miso/tonkotsu available).
        410716_0939_transcription

      o

        Sushi rolls: *12 total* (10 easy “regulars” like California,
        spicy tuna/salmon/yellowtail, shrimp tempura, Philadelphia, eel,
        “crunchy caliente,” Las Vegas, Tootsie; plus 2 specialties:
        *Dragon* + *Candy Cane*). Avoid time-consuming sliced-fish
        toppers. 410716_0939_transcription

  *

    *Service flow:* You take orders and payments at the *Trapper Dan
    “trap” desk* (or table), then *run tickets to the kitchen*; DIY
    runners instead of paid staff if needed. 410716_0939_transcription

  *

    *Water:* Don’t bring branded bottles; set up *unmarked pitchers*
    with cups near the event space. 410716_0854_transcription


    Decor & Vibe

  *

    *Holiday build-out:* Palm-wrap lights, gift boxes, photo throne,
    Christmas tree. Consider a fun theme night later (e.g., “Cantina
    Night”), but KK6 stays holiday-forward. 410716_0854_transcription

  *

    *Novel bits/jokes:* There were wild “little person on the bar /
    Total Recall” ideas—funny but not essential; treat as off-topic.
    410716_1002_transcription


    Capacity / Crowd

  *

    Banter about “600 people” sounded like hype, not an ops target. Plan
    assuming last year’s scale with similar turnout.
    410716_1022_transcription


    Off-Topic / Side Threads (keep separate from KK6)

  *

    *Bug/compost venture (frass/worms/BSFL)* and cactus-specific
    fertilizers—good business idea, not for KK6 ops.
    410716_1028_transcription

  *

    *Pizza-roll/sushi mashups, party stories, memes*—fun chatter, not
    actionable. 410716_1005_transcription 410716_0959_transcription

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Action Items (Do This Week)

 1.

    *Zoning test:* Tape out DJ/KannaKlaus footprints on site; confirm
    smoke-free deck vs smoking on dirt; choose final Santa photo spot
    away from DJ. 410716_0854_transcription

 2.

    *Lighting & decor list:* Palms wraps, tree, throne chair, wrapped
    boxes, extension cords, zip ties. (Skip extra lights if existing
    strings suffice.) 410716_0854_transcription

 3.

    *Fountain treatment:* Assign someone to drain/bleach/clean to reduce
    mosquitoes. 410716_1028_transcription

 4.

    *Toy-box logistics:* Print signage + donation guidelines; *place
    first box Nov 1 at venue*; schedule pickups. 410716_0854_transcription

 5.

    *Menu lock & print:* One-page “express” menu (12 rolls + core
    entrees + fried rice w/ protein pick + a few apps). Avoid sliced-
    fish toppers. 410716_0939_transcription

 6.

    *Order flow kit:* Clipboards/order pads, QR for payment, runner
    badges, trays, and a staging surface at the Trapper Dan booth.
    410716_0939_transcription

 7.

    *Raffle inventory:* Confirm counts with *Chill* and *Special K*
    (aim: 10 each); start list for any other pledged items (Eli, etc.).
    410716_0854_transcription

 8.

    *Vendor outreach:* Slot Trapper Dan + 1 more; share table map and
    load-in rules (no smoking on deck; smoke in dirt).
    410716_0854_transcription

 9.

    *Water station:* Buy neutral pitchers/cups; designate refill spot.
    410716_0854_transcription

10.

    *Content plan touchpoint:* Tease *Nov 1* box drop (reel), then
    weekly updates on box locations + raffle previews.
    410716_0854_transcription

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Open Questions

  *

    Final event *date/time window* and run-of-show (raffle times,
    KannaKlaus photo blocks). 410716_0854_transcription

  *

    Do you want *ramen* included or keep it off the express menu to
    simplify? 410716_0939_transcription

  *

    Will you *hire a server* for two hours or keep it all in-house with
    runners? 410716_0939_transcription

  *

    Exact *vendor count* and booth fees (if any). 410716_0854_transcription

got it — we’ll *include ramen*.

Here’s the *updated Food & Service* block you can drop in:
