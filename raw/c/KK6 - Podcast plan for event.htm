We want to make do a podcast weekly leading up to the kickback. We can do six or seven of them in that amount of time. And we want to do the podcasts in order to have to get clips that we can use as marketing contact the event on social media


            ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that’s a smart and efficient move. Here’s a simple framework
so you can pull the most value from each podcast while keeping
production tight and focused on *marketing the Kanna Kickback*:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🎙️ *Kanna Kickback Podcast Plan (6–7 Episodes)*


      🎯 *Purpose*

Create a weekly podcast series leading up to the Kickback that:

  *

    Builds anticipation for the event.

  *

    Highlights community, culture, and behind-the-scenes stories.

  *

    Produces short, engaging clips for social media promotion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🗓️ *Schedule*

*1 episode per week* leading up to the event (6–7 total).
Each episode: *30–45 minutes max*
Goal: *3–6 reusable clips* (15–60 seconds) per episode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🎧 *Episode Outline Ideas*

 1.

    *Episode 1: “What’s the Kanna Kickback?”*

      *

        Origin story — how it started, why it matters.

      *

        What makes this year special.

      *

        Sneak peek of what’s coming (music, vendors, community).

      *

        *Clip potential:* “This ain’t just an event — it’s a vibe.”

 2.

    *Episode 2: “The Crew Behind the Kickback”*

      *

        Interview organizers and key people (Uncle Blaze, Franky, etc).

      *

        Real talk about the grind, stress, and passion behind it.

      *

        *Clip potential:* Team moments, funny stories, raw authenticity.

 3.

    *Episode 3: “The Culture Lives Here”*

      *

        Discuss the community — how weed culture, art, and music intersect.

      *

        Highlight what the Kickback represents beyond weed.

      *

        *Clip potential:* Relatable takes, cultural insights, “for the
        people” energy.

 4.

    *Episode 4: “Vendors & Artists Spotlight”*

      *

        Showcase vendors, performers, or brands involved.

      *

        Maybe pre-record short guest segments.

      *

        *Clip potential:* Brand collabs, hype moments, unique product
        teases.

 5.

    *Episode 5: “The Kickback Playlist”*

      *

        Talk about the music lineup or theme — maybe play snippets.

      *

        Discuss the vibe of past events.

      *

 6.

    *Episode 6: “The Kickback Manifesto”*

      *

        Talk about what the movement stands for.

      *

        What the future looks like beyond the event.

      *

        *Clip potential:* Motivational quotes, unity messaging, calls to
        action.

 7.

    /(Optional)/ *Episode 7: “Final Countdown”*

      *

        Last-minute event details, shoutouts, expectations, giveaways.

      *

        *Clip potential:* “We’re just days away…” countdown snippets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🎬 *Content Strategy*

  *

    Record *video + audio* to maximize output.

  *

    After each episode, cut *5–6 clips* (30–60 seconds) for reels,
    TikToks, and YouTube Shorts.

  *

    Use *captions + branding* (Kickback logo, event date, and social tag).

  *

    Include *event CTA* in every clip:
    /“Come vibe with us at the Kanna Kickback — [date/location].”/

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    ⚙️ *Production Tips*

  *

    Keep setup simple: one camera angle, clean audio, chill vibe.

  *

    Use segments or prompts to make clipping easy (like “Quick Hit
    Round” questions).

  *

    Assign someone (or use your AI tools) to *auto-generate clips* from
    transcripts.

  *

    Create a *consistent intro/outro* with Kickback branding and music.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    📈 *Goal*

By event week, you’ll have:

  *

    ~6 podcast episodes on Spotify/YouTube.

  *

    ~30–40 short clips for daily posting.

  *

    Built consistent buzz and reinforced the Kickback’s brand voice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would you like me to write out a *template episode structure* (like time
breakdowns, questions, and segment ideas) so it’s plug-and-play for
recording?

Here's the convo we've been having 


            ChatGPT said:

Perfect — this convo actually gives a really clear foundation for your
*Kanna Kickback Podcast Series* plan. Here’s a cleaned-up version of
what you and Gilbert already outlined, expanded into a structured,
usable format so you can move straight into production and clip planning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🎙️ *Kanna Kickback Podcast Series – Pre-Event Run (6–7 Episodes)*


      🎯 *Purpose*

Build momentum for the Kickback through authentic conversations that:

  *

    Highlight the mission, charity aspect, and community impact.

  *

    Showcase the people, sponsors, and vibe behind the event.

  *

    Generate short-form clips for social media marketing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🗓️ *Schedule Overview*

  *

    *6–7 total episodes* (1 per week leading up to the event).

  *

    *30–45 min* per episode.

  *

    Each yields *3–6 short clips (30–60 seconds)* for TikTok, IG, and
    YouTube.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🧩 *Episode Topics (Based on Your Conversation)*


      *Ep 1 — History of the Kickback*

  *

    How the event started, who’s been involved, and how it’s evolved.

  *

    Talk about past years’ highlights, lessons, and funny memories.

  *

    /Clips:/ “How it all began,” “The real reason we throw this every year.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *Ep 2 — The Sojourner Center Connection*

  *

    Why this charity matters and what it represents.

  *

    Talk about the funds raised and the impact so far.

  *

    Use that *Joyner Center news story* clip you mentioned for context.

  *

    /Clips:/ “What every dollar really does,” “We give back, period.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *Ep 3 — The Venue + Vibe*

  *

    Spotlight the venue and what makes this year’s setup unique.

  *

    Discuss design, layout, art, and how it ties into the Kickback’s
    culture.

  *

    /Clips:/ “It’s not just a venue — it’s an experience,” “Setting the
    scene for KK6.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *Ep 4 — Vendors & Sponsors*

  *

    Shout out all the local brands, artists, and sponsors supporting the
    event.

  *

    Could feature quick audio drops or call-ins from them.

  *

    /Clips:/ “Community over competition,” “Everyone eats at the Kickback.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *Ep 5 — The Cannacrew*

  *

    Deep dive into the crew itself — who’s who, what everyone brings.

  *

    Mention *King, Chill, Special K*, and their unique contributions.

  *

    /Clips:/ “The Crew makes this possible,” “We built this from the
    ground up.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *Ep 6 — Highlights & Goals*

  *

    Recap milestones (amounts raised, community growth).

  *

    Discuss future goals: expanding, more cities, more causes.

  *

    /Clips:/ “Where we’re headed,” “This is just the start.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *Ep 7 (Optional Bonus) — Final Countdown*

  *

    Hype episode just before the event: last-minute drops, giveaways,
    reminders.

  *

    Include a call-to-action: “Pull up to the Kickback!”

  *

    /Clips:/ “It’s almost time,” “See y’all at KK6.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🧠 *Production Method*

Keep it *conversational and real* — you two just bouncing thoughts and
stories.
No need for heavy editing; aim for a relaxed, intimate vibe.


      Suggested Setup

  *

    2 mics, 1 camera (wide), clean background with Kickback branding.

  *

    Record audio separately (even phone mics can work if done right).

  *

    Tag or timestamp funny/impactful moments during editing for clip
    extraction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🎬 *Post-Recording Workflow*

 1.

    Transcribe (AI app or AssemblyAI).

 2.

    Pull best quotes and cut into 15–60s reels.

 3.

    Add captions, logo, and Kickback date.

 4.

    Post 2–3 clips per week per platform.

 5.

    Use hashtags: *#KannaKickback #Cannacrew #KK6 #CommunityCulture*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would you like me to build you a *Google Sheet-style content calendar*
for this (episode schedule, recording dates, clip rollout, and post
cadence)? It’ll help you stay consistent and “methodicize the podcast”
like you said.


          You said:

So special K chill and King palms are all people. We've reached out to be sponsors. They're not part of the crew. They're just sponsors and they've been f****** with us. We'll at least chill in special cave and f****** with us on multiple kickbacks kickbacks in the past, so they're like our primary sponsor also included in that. You could include Trapper Dan clothing. But I think that maybe they I think that maybe they don't go into the episode about the canna crew. Instead they go in an episode about vendors and sponsors or whatever


            ChatGPT said:

Got it — that’s perfect context. So here’s the *updated breakdown* with
those details locked in — keeping the flow of episodes logical and
structured for storytelling and clip content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🎙️ *Kanna Kickback Podcast Series (Pre-Event Run)*

*Goal:* Build weekly hype for the Kickback, highlight community and
cause, and create endless clip material.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *Ep 1 — “What Is the Kanna Kickback?”*

  *

    The origin story: how it started, why it exists.

  *

    The vibe, the mission, and how it’s grown.

  *

    Introduce this year’s theme and purpose.

  *

    /Clip targets:/ “We built this for the people,” “It’s more than an

    Use it as a platform to give thanks, maybe tease giveaways or collabs.

    🎬 *Clip Strategy*

Each episode should yield:

  *

    3–6 short clips (15–60s)

  *

    1–2 “reelable” quotes

  *

    1–2 “funny or real” behind-the-scenes bits

Tag lines in all clips:
*#KannaKickback #Cannacrew #KK6 #CommunityCulture #SupportLocal*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    🔧 Production Tip

When you record the /Vendors & Sponsors/ episode, make sure you:

  *

    Mention each sponsor’s name clearly (for tagging and potential co-
    posting).

  *

    Record a separate 20–30s thank-you clip for each brand — they’ll
    probably share it too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would you like me to turn this outline into a *shoot-ready script/
segment sheet* (with talking points, time marks, and clip cue markers
for each episode)?
That’ll make filming smoother and guarantee you come out with usable
social content every time.
