# Email Marketing Best Practices for KK6 Event Promotion

**Context:** 2,000+ email list (dormant since KK5 in 2024), promoting Dec 6, 2025 event, mix of Arizona locals and out-of-state supporters

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Quick Action Items

**For Email Blast #1 (Immediate Use):**
- **Subject Line:** 41 characters max, personalized, acknowledge the gap
- **Email Length:** 50-100 words for first re-engagement, 200-300 words max for event details
- **Structure:** Single column, mobile-first, one clear CTA
- **Timing:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 9-11am or 1-3pm Arizona time
- **Segmentation:** YES - separate messages for local vs. out-of-state
- **Images:** 1-2 optimized images (<100KB), use alt text
- **CTAs:** ONE primary CTA ("RSVP Now" or "Learn More"), 44x44px minimum
- **Deliverability:** Authenticate with SPF/DKIM/DMARC, warm up sends gradually

---

## 1. RE-ENGAGING A DORMANT EMAIL LIST

### The Challenge
- You lose ~22.5% of subscribers annually due to inactivity
- A subscriber is "inactive" after 3-6 months of no opens/clicks
- Your list hasn't engaged since KK5 (2024), so re-engagement is CRITICAL

### Best Practices for Re-Engagement

**✅ ACKNOWLEDGE THE GAP**
- Start subject line or preheader with "We've missed you" or similar
- Be honest and transparent about the time gap
- Example: "We're back! KannaKickback 6 is coming December 6th"

**✅ OFFER AN INCENTIVE**
- Exclusive promotion or early access for loyal subscribers
- For KK6: "First 50 RSVPs get exclusive KannaKlaus swag" or "Early access to vendor booth map"
- Include incentive in subject line/preheader to capture attention immediately

**✅ PERSONALIZATION IS KEY**
- Use subscriber's name
- Reference past interactions ("You came to KK5 last year!")
- Personalized subject lines see 35.69% open rate vs. 16.67% non-personalized

**✅ TEST PLAIN-TEXT FORMAT**
- Plain-text emails can OUTPERFORM designed templates for dormant subscribers
- Consider A/B testing: half get plain-text, half get designed template
- Reduces "marketing" feel, increases personal connection

**✅ SEGMENT BY ENGAGEMENT LEVEL**
- Place dormant subscribers in separate segment
- Prioritize most recently engaged subscribers first
- Send to "warm" segment first, then gradually reach out to colder segments

**✅ VOLUME MANAGEMENT**
- Do NOT increase overall deployments by more than 10% of normal volume
- For 2,000 subscribers: Start with 200-400 most engaged, then increase
- This preserves deliverability while including dormant recipients

**✅ CAMPAIGN FREQUENCY**
- Run re-engagement campaigns twice yearly (perfect timing for KK6!)
- Creates consistent touchpoint without overwhelming subscribers

### Expected Results
- Win-back email flows can reduce 22.5% annual loss significantly
- Focus on long-term value metrics, not just immediate opens/clicks
- Be patient - re-engagement takes time

## 2. EVENT PROMOTION EMAIL STRUCTURE

### Essential Components (In Order)

**1. SUBJECT LINE** (see section 3 for detailed best practices)
- Clear, concise, engaging
- Makes difference between open vs. trash

**2. HEADER/PREHEADER**
- Bold H1-style statement reinforcing urgency, value, or clarity
- Example: "Join 500+ Cannabis Enthusiasts for KannaKickback 6"

**3. EVENT DETAILS (Prominent Placement)**
- Event name: KannaKickback 6
- Date: Friday, December 6, 2025
- Time: [specific time]
- Location: [venue address]
- Keep this section scannable - use bullet points or bold text

**4. VALUE PROPOSITION**
- Clear ROI messaging compels readers to act
- For KK6: "Join the party + support Sojourner Center families"
- Highlight what attendees will experience (games, giveaways, vendors, KannaKlaus)

**5. KEY EVENT FEATURES**
- Speakers, workshops, networking opportunities (or in KK6 case: vendors, games, prizes)
- "Learn from top experts" becomes "Meet top Arizona dispensaries and smoke shops"
- Use bullet points for scannability

**6. CALL-TO-ACTION (CTA)**
- Strong CTA button mirroring event branding
- Include relevant landing page (RSVP form or event page)
- See section 6 for detailed CTA best practices

**7. ADDITIONAL HELPFUL ELEMENTS**
- **"Add to Calendar" link** in footer to capture commitment
- **Event agenda/schedule** so recipients can quickly plan
- **Social proof:** "Join 200+ confirmed attendees!" or "KK5 raised $6,500 for Sojourner Center"

### Email Sequence Strategy

**Recommended sequence for KK6:**
1. **Save-the-Date/Re-engagement** (First email - NOW)
2. **Mid-cycle reminder** with more event details (2-3 weeks before)
3. **One week before** with final details, toy drive reminder
4. **Last chance to register** (2-3 days before)
5. **Day-of reminder** with parking/logistics

**Note:** You have about 5 emails in the sequence before people stop engaging - use them wisely!

---

## 3. SUBJECT LINE BEST PRACTICES

### Optimal Length

**The Sweet Spot:** 41 characters or 7 words
- AWeber analysis: Average is 44 characters
- Backlinko research: 36-70 characters work best
- Best performers: 2-4 words only
- Some research suggests 17-24 characters

**Mobile Optimization (CRITICAL):**
- Mobile inboxes display only first 33-43 characters
- **Optimal character length visible across all devices: 33 characters**
- Put most important words FIRST

### What Works for Higher Open Rates

**✅ PERSONALIZATION**
- 35.69% open rate (personalized) vs. 16.67% (non-personalized)
- Example: "Hey [Name], we're back for KK6!"

**✅ BE DIRECT**
- Sometimes direct > trendy
- "KannaKickback 6: Dec 6 - RSVP Now" beats "You won't believe what's happening Dec 6..."

**✅ CREATE URGENCY**
- Use words like "now," "direct," "free," "limited"
- "Last chance," "Early bird," "Limited spots"

**✅ AVOID SPAM TRIGGERS**
- Don't use ALL CAPS
- Avoid excessive punctuation (!!!)
- Skip spam words: "FREE!!!" "ACT NOW!!!" "LIMITED TIME OFFER!!!"

### Subject Line Examples for KK6

**For Re-engagement (First Email):**
- "We missed you! KK6 is Dec 6" (27 characters) ✅
- "[Name], KannaKickback is back!" (Personalized, direct) ✅
- "KannaKlaus needs you Dec 6" (26 characters, playful) ✅

**For Subsequent Emails:**
- "3 weeks until KK6 - RSVP now" (28 characters)
- "New KK6 vendors announced" (25 characters)
- "Last call: KK6 is this Friday" (29 characters)

### A/B TESTING
- Test different lengths and styles
- Split list: half get short subject line, half get longer
- Track which performs better with YOUR audience
- Resend uses A/B testing - take advantage of it!

---

## 4. EMAIL FORMATTING BEST PRACTICES

### Email Length

**First Re-engagement Email:**
- Keep it SHORT: 50-100 words max
- Focus on one key message: "We're back, save the date"
- Avoid huge paragraphs

**Subsequent Event Detail Emails:**
- 200-300 words ideal
- Use bullet points, numbered lists, icons
- Short paragraphs of 2-3 sentences max
- Remember: Busy prospects SKIM

### Images

**How Many:**
- 1-2 optimized images for first email
- More images OK for later emails (vendor spotlights, event photos)
- **IMPORTANT:** Keep text-to-image ratio high (more text than images)

**Image Optimization:**
- File size: <100KB each (faster loading)
- Display well on high-DPI screens
- Width: 320-480 pixels for mobile scaling
- **ALWAYS include alt text** in case images blocked/fail to load
- Total email weight: <100KB ideal

**Image vs. Text Balance:**
- Don't rely solely on images for key information
- Key details (date, time, location) should be in TEXT
- Images should enhance, not replace, content

### Email Width & Layout

**Width:**
- 600 pixels wide (standard for email clients' preview panes)
- Single-column layout (NOT multi-column)
- Mobile-first design approach

**Font Sizes:**
- Regular text: 14-16px
- Headlines: 22px
- Big enough for mobile readability

**Spacing:**
- Extra breathing room between elements
- 10-20px extra space around clickable areas (thumb-friendly)
- Use whitespace to help CTA stand out

### Mobile Optimization (CRITICAL)

**Why it matters:**
- 44.7% of email opens happen on mobile devices
- Mobile is the TOP way people read email

**Mobile-first checklist:**
- ✅ Single-column layout
- ✅ Font size 14-16px minimum
- ✅ Touch targets 44x44px minimum
- ✅ Images scale properly (320-480px width)
- ✅ CTA buttons are thumb-friendly
- ✅ No tiny links or text
- ✅ Test on actual mobile devices before sending

## 5. SEGMENTATION STRATEGIES: LOCAL VS. OUT-OF-STATE

### Why Geographic Segmentation Matters

**The Problem:**
- Shoppers outside your area aren't likely to open emails about in-person events in distant locations
- Out-of-state supporters may feel excluded if email focuses only on in-person attendance
- Local supporters need different information (parking, local toy drop-off locations) than remote supporters

**The Solution:**
Geographic segmentation groups subscribers by location, enabling targeted emails about local events, promotions, or information relevant to someone's region.

### KK6 Segmentation Strategy

**Segment 1: Arizona Locals (Priority)**
- ~Few hundred subscribers
- Can physically attend Dec 6 event
- Can drop off toys at local dispensaries/smoke shops

**Segment 2: Out-of-State Supporters (Majority)**
- ~1,500+ subscribers
- Cannot physically attend
- Still care about cause and want to support

### Different Messages for Different Segments

**LOCAL SUPPORTERS EMAIL FOCUS:**
- ✅ Event attendance ("Join us Dec 6!")
- ✅ RSVP link prominently featured
- ✅ Local toy drop-off locations
- ✅ Parking/logistics information
- ✅ Vendor booth map/layout
- ✅ Local dispensary partners
- ✅ "See you there!" energy

**Sample CTA for Locals:** "RSVP for Dec 6" or "Reserve Your Spot"

**OUT-OF-STATE SUPPORTERS EMAIL FOCUS:**
- ✅ Mission/cause focus ("Help us support Sojourner Center families")
- ✅ How they can participate remotely:
  - Share event on social media
  - Donate directly to cause
  - Spread word to Arizona friends
- ✅ Event updates/photos (keep them connected)
- ✅ "You're part of KannaKrew family even from afar" messaging
- ✅ Show impact of past events (social proof)

**Sample CTA for Out-of-State:** "Share KK6 with Friends" or "Support the Cause" or "Follow Our Journey"

### Implementation with Resend API

**How to segment:**
1. Tag subscribers by location when importing list
2. Create two separate campaigns:
   - Campaign A: Arizona locals
   - Campaign B: Out-of-state supporters
3. Adjust content accordingly
4. Send both campaigns same day/time for consistency

**Benefits:**
- Higher open rates (content is relevant to recipient)
- Lower unsubscribe rates (not sending irrelevant info)
- Better engagement overall
- Out-of-state supporters feel included, not excluded

---

## 6. CALL-TO-ACTION (CTA) BEST PRACTICES

### The Critical Rule: ONE Primary CTA

**Why one CTA?**
- Reducing CTAs from four to one = 42% increase in click-through rates
- Multiple CTAs confuse readers: "Should I RSVP or visit landing page or share on social?"
- ONE clear action = higher conversion

### CTA Copy Best Practices

**Length:**
- 2-4 words ideal
- Use action-oriented words: "Register Now," "RSVP Today," "Download," "Sign Up"

**First-Person Perspective:**
- Makes it personal and motivating
- Example: "I want to join" vs. "Join now"
- Helps readers identify with the action

**Create Urgency:**
- Include words like "now," "direct," "free"
- "Register Now" beats "Register"
- Stimulates action today instead of next week

### CTA Design Specifications

**Size (CRITICAL for Mobile):**
- Minimum 44x44px (Apple's touch target recommendation)
- Thumb-friendly = easier taps = more conversions
- Add generous padding around button

**Color:**
- Choose color that stands out from rest of email
- Don't reuse button color elsewhere in email
- High contrast for visibility
- Match brand colors when possible (KannaKrew green?)

**Placement:**
- Place most important CTA early in email
- Keep primary CTA towards top (readers may not scroll)
- Can repeat CTA at bottom for scrollers

**Whitespace:**
- 10-20px extra space around CTA
- Helps button stand out
- Prevents accidental clicks on nearby elements

### CTA Examples for KK6

**For Local Supporters:**
- "RSVP for Dec 6" (Primary)
- "Reserve My Spot"
- "Count Me In"
- "I Want to Join" (First-person)

**For Out-of-State Supporters:**
- "Share KK6" (Primary)
- "Support the Cause"
- "Spread the Word"
- "Follow Our Journey"

**Secondary CTAs (Use Sparingly):**
- Text link (not button) at bottom: "Learn more about Sojourner Center"
- Social media icons in footer (low-key)

### Landing Page Optimization

**Make RSVP process simple:**
- Clear, visible CTA on landing page
- Minimal form fields (name, email, maybe phone)
- Mobile-optimized page
- Fast loading time

**A/B Testing:**
- Test different CTA button colors
- Test different CTA copy ("RSVP Now" vs. "Reserve Spot")
- Test button placement (top vs. middle vs. both)
- Track which performs better

## 7. EMAIL DELIVERABILITY: AVOIDING SPAM FILTERS

### 2025 Authentication Requirements (CRITICAL)

**For senders of 5,000+ emails/day:**
- Gmail, Yahoo, Microsoft REQUIRE:
  - DMARC authentication
  - SPF authentication
  - DKIM authentication
- Maintain spam complaint rate BELOW 0.3%

**Your situation (2,000 emails):**
- Below 5,000 threshold BUT still best practice to implement
- Resend API should handle this automatically - VERIFY before sending

### IP Warmup Strategy (CRITICAL for Dormant Lists)

**The Problem:**
- Sending high volume immediately raises spam filter red flags
- Your list is dormant since 2024 = high risk

**The Solution (GRADUAL SENDING):**

**Week 1:**
- Send to 200 most engaged subscribers (10% of list)
- Monitor bounce rates and spam complaints

**Week 2:**
- If Week 1 went well, send to next 400 subscribers (20% of list)
- Total: 600 subscribers (30%)

**Week 3:**
- Send to next 600 subscribers (30% of list)
- Total: 1,200 subscribers (60%)

**Week 4:**
- Send to remaining 800 subscribers (40% of list)
- Total: ALL 2,000 subscribers

**Alternative (Faster):**
- Day 1: 400 subscribers (20%)
- Day 3: 600 subscribers (30%)
- Day 5: 1,000 subscribers (50%)

**IMPORTANT:** Adjust timeline based on event date (Dec 6). If sending now (Nov 20), you have 2 weeks - use faster approach.

### List Hygiene (Do Before Sending)

**✅ CLEAN YOUR LIST:**
- Remove invalid email addresses
- Remove bounced addresses from previous campaigns
- Remove unengaged subscribers who haven't opened in 2+ years
- Remove spam traps (emails like test@test.com)

**❌ NEVER BUY LISTS:**
- Purchased lists = "deliverability poison"
- Recipients don't expect your email = spam complaints
- Lists contain spam traps and outdated addresses

### Email Content Best Practices for Deliverability

**Email Length:**
- Aim for 50-100 words per email at most (first email)
- Focus on one key message
- Avoid buzzwords or filler - spam filters dislike overly salesy language

**Link Count:**
- Too many links = spam filter trigger
- First email: Stick to ONE link (two at most)
- Later emails: 2-3 links maximum

**Avoid Spam Trigger Words:**
- ❌ "FREE!!!" "ACT NOW!!!" "LIMITED TIME OFFER!!!"
- ❌ ALL CAPS in subject line
- ❌ Excessive punctuation (!!!)
- ✅ Use normal conversational language

### AI-Powered Spam Filters (2025 Reality)

**What's Changed:**
- Email providers now use AI to detect:
  - Low-quality content
  - Mass-sent emails
  - Irrelevant content
- Systems analyze multiple emails + behavioral signals to establish patterns

**How to Beat AI Filters:**
- Personalization (shows email is targeted, not mass-sent)
- High engagement (opens, clicks, replies)
- Relevant content (segment your list)
- Consistent sending (don't disappear for months then blast)

### Engagement Metrics Matter (MOST IMPORTANT)

**The New Reality:**
- Recipient engagement determines deliverability
- If recipients don't interact, future emails get filtered out
- Open rates, click-throughs, replies = deliverability score

**How to Improve Engagement:**
- Re-engagement strategy (acknowledge the gap)
- Segmentation (send relevant content)
- Compelling subject lines (get opens)
- Clear CTAs (get clicks)
- Personalization (increase interaction)

### Deliverability Checklist for KK6 Email Blast

- [ ] Authenticate with SPF/DKIM/DMARC (verify Resend handles this)
- [ ] Clean email list (remove bounces, invalid addresses)
- [ ] Segment list by engagement level (most engaged first)
- [ ] Warm up sends gradually (don't blast all 2,000 at once)
- [ ] Keep first email short (50-100 words)
- [ ] Limit links (1-2 max in first email)
- [ ] Avoid spam trigger words
- [ ] Personalize where possible (use names)
- [ ] Monitor bounce rates and spam complaints
- [ ] Track engagement metrics (opens, clicks)

## 8. TIMING & FREQUENCY BEST PRACTICES

### When to Send: Best Days

**Data shows:**
- **Tuesday = MOST POPULAR** (both U.S. and U.K.)
- **Wednesday = Second best** (U.S. preference)
- **Midweek = Optimal** (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Monday (inboxes are full, people catching up)
- ❌ Friday (people mentally checking out)
- ❌ Weekends (people don't check email as frequently)

**Exception for KK6:**
- If organizing professional event: Weekdays
- If music venue/casual event: Weekends may work
- For cannabis-friendly party: Weekdays likely still best

### When to Send: Best Times of Day

**Data shows:**
- Subscribers most active between **2pm - 5pm** (in their time zone)
- Opens increase after 12pm
- **Morning hours (9-11am):** Good for promotional emails (people check during work breaks)
- **Early afternoon (1-3pm):** Also effective (lunch break, afternoon check-in)

**For KK6 (Arizona Time = UTC-7):**
- **Option 1:** Tuesday/Wednesday, 9-11am Arizona time
- **Option 2:** Tuesday/Wednesday, 1-3pm Arizona time

**IMPORTANT:** Consider time zones for out-of-state supporters
- Send at reasonable time for Arizona (your event location)
- Most U.S. time zones will receive during business hours

### Email Frequency: How Many Emails Before Event?

**Industry Data:**
- 25% of event creators: 3 emails per event
- 30% of event creators: 4-5 emails per event
- 22% of event creators: 6+ emails per event

**Recommended Frequency:**
- Months before event: 1 email every 2 weeks
- 6-8 weeks out: 1 email per week
- Week before: 2 emails (details + last call)
- Day of: 1 email (final reminder/logistics)

**For KK6 Timeline (Nov 20 - Dec 6 = 16 days):**

**Email 1 (Nov 20-21):** Re-engagement + Save the Date
- "We're back! KK6 is Dec 6"
- Basic event info, toy drive reminder
- Send to most engaged segment first (200-400 people)

**Email 2 (Nov 25-26):** Event Details + Vendor Announcements
- More detail about what to expect
- Highlight vendors, games, prizes
- Toy drop-off locations
- Send to next segment (600-800 people)

**Email 3 (Nov 29-30):** One Week Reminder
- "One week until KK6!"
- Final RSVP push
- Parking/logistics info
- Send to remaining segment (rest of list)

**Email 4 (Dec 3-4):** Last Call
- "Last chance to RSVP"
- Event schedule/agenda
- What to bring
- Send to ALL subscribers

**Email 5 (Dec 6):** Day-of Reminder
- "See you tonight!"
- Address, parking, start time
- Contact info for questions
- Send to confirmed attendees only

**Total:** 5 emails over 16 days
- Within recommended range (most creators send 3-6)
- Accounts for dormant list (need more touchpoints)

### Warning: Don't Overdo It

**Too many emails:**
- Frustrates recipients
- Tanks open rates
- Boosts unsubscribes

**Too few emails:**
- Reduces engagement
- People forget about event

**Finding Balance:**
- Track open rates email-by-email
- If open rates drop below 15%, you're sending too much
- Data shows 5 emails is sweet spot before people stop engaging

### First Announcement Timing

**Industry Data:**
- 27% send first announcement 2-3 months in advance
- 26% send first announcement 1 month before event

**KK6 Situation:**
- Event is Dec 6
- Sending first email around Nov 20
- That's ~16 days before = LATE but OK for smaller events

**Factors affecting timing:**
- Big festivals/conferences: Announce months early (recurring annual events)
- Smaller events/weekly events: Can announce closer to date
- KK6 is annual but smaller-scale = 2-3 weeks notice is acceptable
- Dormant list = sending too early risks people forgetting

### Testing is Critical

**Important caveat:**
- There is NO "ideal send time" that works for every marketer
- Must test to discover what works for YOUR audience
- Different industries/brands have different optimal times

**How to test:**
- A/B test send times: Half get Tuesday 9am, half get Wednesday 2pm
- Track open rates, click rates for each
- Use insights for future campaigns

## SPECIFIC ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS

### Q: How long should the email be?

**A: For Email Blast #1 (Re-engagement):**
- **50-100 words MAXIMUM**
- Focus on ONE key message: "We're back, save the date"
- Subsequent emails can be 200-300 words

**Structure:**
```
Subject: We missed you! KK6 is Dec 6

Hey [Name],

We've missed you! KannaKickback is back for year 6.

Join us Friday, December 6 for our biggest holiday party yet - games, giveaways, top vendors, and KannaKlaus himself. Plus, we're supporting Sojourner Center families with our annual toy drive.

[RSVP BUTTON]

Can't make it? Here's how you can still help: [link]

- The KannaKrew
```

That's ~65 words. Perfect length.

---

### Q: Should we include images or keep it text-heavy?

**A: Include 1-2 optimized images, but keep it text-heavy.**

**For Email #1:**
- 1 image: KannaKlaus character OR KK6 event graphic
- File size: <100KB
- Width: 320-480px (mobile-optimized)
- Include alt text: "KannaKickback 6 - Dec 6, 2025"

**Important:**
- Put key info (date, time, location) in TEXT, not image
- Text-to-image ratio should favor text
- If images fail to load, email should still make sense
- Plain-text may outperform designed template for dormant list - TEST IT

**Recommendation:**
- A/B test: Half get plain-text email, half get 1-image email
- See which performs better with YOUR dormant list

---

### Q: How many CTAs is too many?

**A: ONE primary CTA maximum.**

**The Data:**
- Reducing CTAs from 4 to 1 = 42% increase in click-through rates
- Multiple CTAs confuse readers
- One clear action = higher conversion

**For Email #1:**
- **PRIMARY CTA (button):** "RSVP for Dec 6" (for locals) or "Learn More" (for out-of-state)
- **SECONDARY CTA (optional, text link at bottom):** "Can't make it? Here's how to help"
- **Footer (low-key):** Social media icons

**Structure:**
```
[Main content]

[PRIMARY CTA BUTTON - Big, bold, prominent]

[Supporting text]

[Optional text link for secondary action]

[Footer with social icons]
```

**Don't do this:**
❌ [RSVP NOW] [Learn More] [Share Event] [Donate] = Too many options = confusion

---

### Q: What's the ideal subject line length?

**A: 33 characters maximum for mobile visibility, 41 characters for desktop.**

**The Data:**
- **Mobile displays:** First 33-43 characters
- **Optimal across all devices:** 33 characters
- **Desktop optimal:** 41 characters or 7 words

**For KK6 Email #1:**
- "We missed you! KK6 is Dec 6" = 29 characters ✅
- "[Name], KannaKickback is back!" = 28-32 characters (with name) ✅
- "KannaKlaus needs you Dec 6" = 26 characters ✅

**Test these:**
- A/B test short (25-30 char) vs. medium (35-40 char)
- See which performs better

**Key rule:** Put most important words FIRST (front-load)
- "Dec 6: We missed you! KK6" = Date is first (good for urgency)
- "We missed you! KK6 is Dec 6" = Personal connection first (good for re-engagement)

---

### Q: Should we acknowledge the long gap since last email?

**A: YES, absolutely acknowledge it.**

**Why:**
- Transparency builds trust
- Shows respect for subscriber relationship
- Re-engagement best practice: "We've missed you" messaging performs well
- 35.69% open rate for personalized/honest approaches

**How to acknowledge:**
- Subject line: "We missed you!" or "Long time, no see"
- Opening line: "It's been a minute since KK5..."
- Honest but brief: Don't over-apologize, just acknowledge

**Example openers:**
- "We've missed you! KannaKickback is back..." ✅
- "It's been a minute, but we're back with KK6..." ✅
- "Remember us? KannaKickback returns Dec 6..." ✅

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Ignore the gap (feels tone-deaf)
- ❌ Over-apologize ("We're SO SORRY we haven't emailed...") - too much
- ❌ Make excuses ("We've been so busy...") - irrelevant

**Balance:**
- Acknowledge briefly (one sentence)
- Quickly pivot to excitement about KK6
- Focus forward, not backward

**Full example:**
```
Subject: We missed you! KK6 is Dec 6

Hey [Name],

It's been a minute since KK5, but we're back and better than ever! KannaKickback 6 is happening Friday, December 6...
```

---

### Q: How to make out-of-state supporters feel included?

**A: Segment the list and send different messages with alternative ways to participate.**

**The Problem:**
- Out-of-state supporters (majority of your list) can't attend Dec 6 event
- If email focuses only on "Join us in Arizona," they feel excluded
- May unsubscribe if content isn't relevant

**The Solution (Segmentation):**

**EMAIL VERSION A: For Arizona Locals**
- Focus: In-person attendance
- CTA: "RSVP for Dec 6"
- Content: Event logistics, parking, vendor map, local toy drop-offs

**EMAIL VERSION B: For Out-of-State Supporters**
- Focus: Remote participation + cause support
- CTA: "Share KK6" or "Support the Cause"
- Content: How they can help from afar

**Out-of-State Email Content Ideas:**

**1. Mission-First Messaging:**
```
Subject: We missed you! KK6 supports Sojourner Center families

Hey [Name],

Even though you can't join us in Arizona, you're still part of the KannaKrew family!

This year we're raising toys for Sojourner Center families - and you can help from wherever you are:
- Share KK6 with your Arizona friends
- Donate directly to Sojourner Center
- Follow our journey on Instagram [@kannakrew]

Can't be there in person? You're still making an impact.

[SHARE KK6 BUTTON]
```

**2. Include Remote Participation Options:**
- Share event on social media (give them graphics to share)
- Donate to cause directly
- Tag Arizona friends who might attend
- Virtual raffle entry (if applicable)
- Early access to event photos/highlights
- Exclusive content ("Behind the scenes with KannaKlaus")

**3. Show Appreciation:**
- "You've supported us since [year] - thank you!"
- "Your past support helped us donate $6,500 to Sojourner Center"
- "You're part of our story even from [their state]"

**4. Keep Them Connected:**
- Share photos/updates after event
- Highlight impact ("Because of supporters like you, we donated X toys")
- Make them feel like insider even if not attending

**5. Future Opportunities:**
- "Will you be in Arizona soon? Check out these local partners..."
- "Our dispensary partners ship nationwide" (if applicable)
- "Visit these KannaKrew-approved spots next time you're in town"

**Segmentation Implementation:**
- Tag subscribers by state when importing to Resend
- Create 2 campaigns: AZ locals vs. Everyone else
- Send same day/time for consistency
- Track which version performs better

**Result:**
- Locals get relevant attendance info
- Out-of-state supporters feel valued and included

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY

### Top 5 Priorities for Email Blast #1

**1. ACKNOWLEDGE THE GAP & RE-ENGAGE**
- Subject line: "We missed you! KK6 is Dec 6" (29 chars)
- Opening line acknowledges time since last email
- Keep it SHORT: 50-100 words max
- Offer incentive (early access, exclusive content)

**2. SEGMENT YOUR LIST**
- Separate messages for Arizona locals vs. out-of-state
- Locals: Focus on event attendance, RSVP
- Out-of-state: Focus on remote participation, sharing
- Make everyone feel included and valued

**3. ONE CLEAR CTA**
- Locals: "RSVP for Dec 6" (button, 44x44px, prominent)
- Out-of-state: "Share KK6" or "Support the Cause"
- No multiple CTAs - keep it simple

**4. MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN**
- Single column layout
- Font size 14-16px
- Images <100KB, 320-480px width
- CTA buttons thumb-friendly
- Test on actual mobile devices

**5. WARM UP YOUR SENDS**
- Don't blast all 2,000 at once
- Start with 200-400 most engaged (Nov 20-21)
- Gradual increase over 5-7 days
- Monitor deliverability closely
