### ✅ MENU APPROVED!
- **Status:** Menu approved by Maggie/Ginza (Nov 10)
- **Items REMOVED from menu:**
  - **Ramen** - Too long to make, complicated ingredients
  - **Dragon Roll** - (Gilbert notes: "really fucking easy" but Maggie said no)
  - **Spicy Yellow** (Yellowtail?) - Too difficult prep
- **10% Revenue Confirmed:** Maggie confirmed via text that KannaKrew gets 10% of food sales (Nov 10)
  - Important: This is for event expenses, NOT donation to Sojourner
  - Gilbert got written confirmation in text message
- **Impact:** Unblocks menu design and printing tasks
- **Next Steps:**
  - Ask Maggie if there's anything else she wants to add to replace removed items
  - Design menu with approved items
  - Prepare for printing

### 🎉 VENUE CRISIS RESOLVED!
- **Gilbert did drive-by of Ginza** (Nov 13)
- Cactus planting DID limit space, but **Gilbert is not worried**
- Quote: "It'll just look more full" - event is still viable
- **Decision:** Moving forward with Ginza venue
- **Status change:** Venue concern downgraded from CRITICAL to MANAGEABLE

### Email Draft Found & Critiqued
- Located existing email draft in `/raw/c/KK6 - Email draft request.htm`
- Gilbert provided detailed critique and revisions needed (Nov 13)
- **Key Changes Required:**
  - Remove "If you're new to us" - they did it last year with Tom's Palms
  - Add context: Tom's Palms was liaison last year, they're sick this year
  - Change "East Valley" to "the Valley" (location varies)
  - Remove KannaKlaus branding from box, keep "festive donation box"
  - Add "social media assets" to what we provide

  - **Sign as: Gilbert Trout** (T-R-O-U-T-T) not Gilbert Figueroa
  - Can separately pitch vendor booth participation

### Content Creation Status (Nov 13)

- ChatGPT refused to generate countdown content
- **Alternative tools:** Grok, Gemini, or Sora for video generation
- Gilbert has posted some content in Discord chat - needs review
- Action plan: Create content → Review all options → Schedule posts
- Post to #ppk-general to get team involvement

### Cartoon Ad Concept
- Gilbert wants animated cartoon ad for kickback
- Style: "Grungy, ganja game style"
- Concept: KannaKlaus workshop → reveals stoned skunk character prototype
- Needs: Storyboard and script for video generator
- **Status:** Idea captured, needs development

### Context Clarifications
- **Last year (KK5):**
  - KannaKrew + Tom's Palms did COMBINED toy drive
  - Tom's Palms had all the dispensary contacts
  - Dispensaries gave pre-roll with each toy donation
  - Nirvana definitely did pre-rolls, others may not have
- **This year (KK6):**
  - Tom's Palms is sick, doing something else for holidays
  - We got dispensary contact info from Tammy (Tom's Palms)
  - Goal: Continue what worked last year without Tom's Palms

- **Team Assessment:** "Our inactivity for so long...we're losing people"
- **Solution Needed:** Show up consistently, not just for events

## 2025-11-10

### Summary:

- **SOJOURNER OUTREACH**: Requested on-camera interview for video content
- Keeping Dec 15 as toy drive cutoff (within their Dec 8-20 window)
- **WEBSITE STRATEGY**: Single site with two audiences
  - Main site (index.html): Community-focused, fun language, no demographics/ROI talk
  - Partners page (partners.html): Pitch deck with business data, demographics, testimonials
  - Strategy: Attendees never see corporate speak, partners get all the data they need
  - Partners page on hold pending design improvements

### Action Items:
1. **🚨 URGENT**: Schedule Ginza walkthrough to assess venue changes - Due: ASAP
2. **🚨 URGENT**: Talk to Maggie about venue renovations without notice - Due: ASAP

  - May only fit vendors in small wooden section
  - Stage moved to accommodate new layout
  - Discussing if event is still viable at this location

## CONTENT IDEAS CAPTURED

From transcripts/meetings:

- Fake AI documentary about Kanna Claus origin
- Crane game highlight reels from past events
- Countdown series with AI-generated pop culture characters
- Vendor spotlight posts
- Toy collection progress updates ("We're at $X in toys!")

---

## QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

1. ✅ ~~**When is Sojourner Center's cutoff date for toy delivery?**~~ RESOLVED: Dec 8-20 window, our cutoff Dec 15
2. **Does Maggie approve the menu?** 🔴 CRITICAL
3. **Do we owe Special K money from last year?** 🟡 IMPORTANT
4. **What was the transportation issue?** 🟢 CLARIFY
5. **Where exactly are the vendor booth areas?** (Patio + dirt overflow)
6. **Do we have a target attendance number?**
7. **Who owns what in the content calendar?** (Gilbert, Speaker A, Dom split)

---

## RANDOM NOTES & IDEAS

- Nov 6 meeting mentioned "ramen addition" - what is this?
- Consider making Kanna Claus a recurring character (AI avatar?)
- Podcast could become annual tradition, not just KK6
- Glass blowers might form their own community through this
- Arizona glass community seems tight-knit, leverage that
- "All K's, no C's" branding is strong, lean into it
- Sojourner Center connection is personal - emphasize in storytelling
