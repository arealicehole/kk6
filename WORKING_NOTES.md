## 2025-11-21 (MORNING) - POST #6 CRITICAL REVISION COMPLETE ⚠️

### 🚨 URGENT: Black Friday Post Concept Changed

**✅ COMPLETE REVISION:** All POST #6 files rewritten with new strategy

**Original Concept (SCRAPPED):**
- "Green Friday vs Black Friday" comparison meme
- Anti-shopping, counter-culture messaging
- "Skip Black Friday" tone
- Cannabis community only focus

**New Concept (APPROVED):**
- "Use Black Friday to Buy Quality Gifts for Teens"
- Educational + empowering messaging
- "Shop smart, give better" tone
- Broad audience (all Black Friday shoppers)

**Why We Changed:**
1. **Critical insight:** Sojourner Center serves TEENAGERS (ages 13-17), not just little kids
2. **Missed opportunity:** Black Friday deals = chance to donate BETTER gifts
3. **Wrong tone:** Original was preachy and alienating to mainstream shoppers
4. **Better strategy:** Embrace shopping for a cause vs opposing consumerism

**Key Messages (NEW):**
- Most people don't know Sojourner serves teens
- Teens don't want stuffed animals - they want headphones, gift cards, makeup, sports gear, tech
- Use Black Friday deals to donate something teens will actually love
- One week between Black Friday (Nov 29) and event (Dec 6) = perfect timing

**Content Format (CHANGED):**
- ❌ OLD: Split-screen comparison meme
- ✅ NEW: 3-slide educational carousel + 20-25 sec video
  - Slide 1: "They have TEENS too" attention grabber
  - Slide 2: 3x3 grid of teen gift ideas (reference material)
  - Slide 3: Event info + donation locations

**Files Revised:**
- ✅ POST_06_CAPTION.md - Complete rewrite with teen focus
- ✅ POST_06_DESIGN_SPECS.md - 3-slide carousel specs (was comparison graphic)
- ✅ POST_06_VIDEO_PROMPT.md - Shopping montage concept (was split-screen meme)
- ✅ POST_06_REVISION_REPORT.md - Full strategic analysis document
- ✅ CONTENT_CALENDAR.md - Updated with revision notes

**Strategic Impact:**
- Estimated reach: 50K-100K+ (was 5K-10K with old concept)
- Target audience: All Black Friday shoppers (was cannabis community only)
- Educational value: HIGH (teaches new info most people don't know)
- Shareability: HIGH (Slide 2 grid is save-worthy reference material)
- Brand alignment: Better (empowering vs preachy)

**Next Steps:**
- Generate 3 carousel slides via visual-creator subagent
- Generate or film video (20-25 seconds)
- Schedule for Nov 29, 8:00 AM Arizona Time
- Monitor Black Friday hashtag performance

**Decision Made By:** Chief Content Editor (newsroom role)
**Approved:** All copy and specs ready for production
**Due:** Nov 27 (assets ready for Nov 29 posting)

## 2025-11-17 LATE NIGHT - TRANSCRIPT REVIEW & TIMELINE CONFLICT

### 📝 Processed Transcripts from Gilbert Conversations
**Source:** `C:\Users\figon\OneDrive\Apps\Cube ACR\2025-11-17\`
**Copied to:** `raw/t/`

**Relevant Transcripts:**
1. **2025-11-17_08-13-58_Gilbert_Early_Planning.txt**
   - Early KK6 planning discussion
   - Only had 2-3 box locations at that time
   - Identified dispensary targets in Apache Junction
   - Tom's Palms said no
   - Arizona Organics - expecting nothing

2. **2025-11-17_14-09-25_Gilbert_Nirvana_Delivery_Planning.txt**
   - Right after Max's first response
   - Planning Nov 18 delivery
   - Special Case bong quote discussion
   - Additional box host leads identified

### 📦 Additional Box Host Leads (From Transcripts)

   - Status: Interested, waiting to talk to partner
   - Source: Instagram DM response

2. **Glendale Shop**
   - Status: Confirmed interested in hosting box
   - Source: DM response

### 🎁 Prize/Raffle Issue (From Transcripts)
**Special Case Quote:** 20-30 medium bullets for $600-900
**Current Inventory:**
- 3-5 unused Special Case pieces
- 3 Greek glass pieces

**Question:** What goes in raffle boxes without major spending?

### ❌ Rejected Dispensaries
- Tom's Palms - declined
- Arizona Organics - no response expected

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TIMELINE CONFLICT DISCOVERED

**Nirvana's Request:** Dec 1-22
**Sojourner Window:** Dec 8-20
**Our Original Plan:** Nov 15 - Dec 15

**THE PROBLEM:** Nirvana wants to run promo through Dec 22, but Sojourner stops accepting toys Dec 20!

**✅ DECISION MADE:**
- **Ask Nirvana for Dec 1-19** (1 day buffer before Sojourner's Dec 20 deadline)
- Gives us Dec 19 pickup → Dec 20 delivery to Sojourner
- Clean timeline, no conflicts

---

1. **Timeline:** Asking Nirvana for Dec 1-19 (counter to their Dec 1-22 request)

**What We Asked For:**

**Reply Sent:** ⚠️ Sent via Resend API but threading FAILED

## 2025-11-17 LATE NIGHT (SECURITY INCIDENT, COMPLETE FORM TRACKING, CREDENTIAL STORAGE)

### 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT - API Keys Exposed to GitHub
**What Happened:** Accidentally committed files with hardcoded credentials to public GitHub repo
- `PIPEDREAM_FIXED_SMTP_FORWARD.js` - Contained SMTP password
- `forward-resend-emails.js` - Contained Resend API key + SMTP password
- Credentials visible in git commit history

**Credentials Exposed:**
- Resend API key: `re_5RBepRp2_Pmi8ccadxi5LqrPHSPFUtEz2` (REVOKED)
- SMTP password: `Rebelde123` (NEEDS CHANGING)

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ User revoked Resend API key immediately
2. ✅ Removed files from git tracking
3. ✅ Added files to `.gitignore`
4. ✅ Created secure credential storage system

**Resolution:**
- Created `.env` file system for secure credential storage
- `.env` added to `.gitignore` (never committed)
- `.env.example` committed as safe template
- Credentials now stored locally, never in git
- Updated MCP settings documentation for email tool

**New Credentials Generated:**
- Resend API key: [NEW KEY GENERATED - stored in `.env`]
- SMTP password: (pending update)

**Files Created:**
- `.env` - Local credentials (gitignored)
- `.env.example` - Safe template (committed)

**Lessons Learned:**
- NEVER hardcode credentials in code files
- ALWAYS use environment variables or secure storage
- ALWAYS check files before committing

### 📊 Complete Form Submissions Tracking - All RSVPs Found
**Verified ALL submissions from Resend CSV export:**

**Found 3 Missing RSVPs** (in Resend but not forwarded by Pipedream):
1. **Sleepy Cheefin** - sleepycheefin@gmail.com - (913) 636-6752 - Nov 15
2. **Susanna Grijalva** - grijalvasu@hotmail.com - (602) 684-6520 - Nov 16
3. **Dustin Morrissey** - morrisseydustin@gmail.com - +626233499114 - Nov 16

**Complete RSVP List (7 Total):**
1. Tara Reynolds - taracoreen13@gmail.com - (480) 215-8843
2. Jesse Duke - jesseduke34@hotmail.com - (602) 425-4529
3. Dustin Morrissey - morrisseydustin@gmail.com - +626233499114
4. Susanna Grijalva - grijalvasu@hotmail.com - (602) 684-6520
5. Sleepy Cheefin - sleepycheefin@gmail.com - (913) 636-6752
6. Deno Easter - deasterdenoeasterdeaster@hotmail.com - (480) 504-7160
7. Rita Pacchiana - ritajeanmary@hotmail.com - (480) 249-5516

**Tracker Cleanup:**
- Removed all spam submissions (KMqdkeivyWodoznHsW, MypmZnWfOeCoOKaDInA, etc.)
- Removed all test submissions (poop, testpoop, Ghost of Christmas Hash, Francis Gonzalez)
- Removed Ben Raker (unclear spam)
- Tracker now shows ONLY 7 real RSVPs with complete contact info

**Updated Document:** `communications/KK6_FORM_SUBMISSIONS_TRACKER.md`
- Clean, professional tracking of real submissions only
- All 7 RSVPs ready for confirmation emails
- Vendor/Box Host sections empty (awaiting real applications)

### 🔐 Secure Credential Storage System
**Problem:** Need secure way to store API keys and passwords without exposing to git

**Solution:** Environment variable system with `.env` files

**How It Works:**
1. **`.env`** - Contains actual credentials (gitignored, never committed)
2. **`.env.example`** - Safe template (committed to git)
3. **MCP Settings** - `claude_code_mcp_settings.json` for MCP tool credentials

**Credential Storage Locations:**
- **Resend API Key:** Stored in `.env` → `RESEND_API_KEY`
- **SMTP Password:** Stored in MCP settings → `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
- **Email Address:** Both `.env` and MCP settings

**Security Model:**
- MCP settings: Claude can USE but not directly SEE values (inherited by tools)
- `.env` file: Claude can read if needed, but never committed to git
- Git: Only `.env.example` template committed, never actual credentials

**Files:**
- `.env` - Actual credentials (local only)
- `.env.example` - Template (safe to commit)
- `.gitignore` - Updated to exclude `.env`, credential files

### 📝 Action Items Generated
- [ ] User: Reset SMTP password for admin@kannakrew.com
- [ ] User: Update SMTP password in MCP settings file
- [ ] Send confirmation emails to all 7 RSVPs
- [ ] Monitor for new form submissions
- [ ] Continue dispensary outreach

## 2025-11-17 EVENING (EMAIL SYSTEM FIX, FORM SUBMISSIONS TRACKING, MASS OUTREACH)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Email System Fixed with Pipedream
**Problem:** Resend was receiving form submissions but NOT forwarding to webmail inbox
- Emails sitting in Resend with no way to access them
- Form submissions from website not reaching admin@kannakrew.com

**Solution:** Pipedream webhook forwarding via SMTP
- Created `PIPEDREAM_FIXED_SMTP_FORWARD.js` workflow
- Uses nodemailer to forward directly to mail.kannakrew.com:465 via SMTP
- Bypasses MX records to avoid infinite loop
- Tracks processed emails in data store to prevent duplicates

**Status:** ✅ WORKING - Successfully forwarded 13 emails on Nov 17
- All form submissions now arriving in inbox with `[FWD] [FORWARDED]` prefix
- New submissions will automatically forward when Pipedream runs

**Email Flow (Final Working Architecture):**
```
Website Form → Resend (receives) → Pipedream Webhook → SMTP to mail.kannakrew.com → Webmail → MCP Tool (IMAP)
```

### 📊 Form Submissions Tracking System Created
**New Document:** `communications/KK6_FORM_SUBMISSIONS_TRACKER.md`
- Comprehensive tracking of all RSVPs, vendor apps, box host apps, contact forms
- Organized by type with contact info, dates, status
- Spam detection and flagging

**Initial Stats (Before Complete Tracking):**
- **Event RSVPs:** 4 forwarded (Tara Reynolds, Jesse Duke, Deno Easter, Rita Pacchiana)
- **Vendor Applications:** 0 real (2 spam/test)
- **Box Host Applications:** 0 real (1 test by Francis, 1 spam)
- **Contact Forms:** 1 unclear (Ben Raker - needs follow-up)
- **Spam Submissions:** 5 total

**Note:** Later discovered 3 additional RSVPs in Resend that weren't forwarded (see Late Night update)

### 📧 Mass Dispensary Outreach - Arizona Phoenix Metro

**Specs Document:** `creative/print/BOX_TOPPER_DESIGN_SPECS.md`

### 🔧 Technical Issues Encountered
1. **Resend API Key Access Problem:**
   - API key restricted to "send only" despite dashboard showing "full access"
   - Cannot use Resend API to read received emails directly
   - Pipedream uses OAuth/app integration which works differently
   - Solution: Continue using Pipedream webhook approach

2. **Email Signature Error (Fixed in Previous Session):**
   - Used wrong name "Gilbert Figueroa" in 4 outreach emails
   - Sent correction emails (user was upset - should not have done this)
   - Posted apology in PPK Discord
   - Now using "KannaKrew" signature only

### ⚠️ Issues to Monitor
- **Missing Emails:** User mentioned "Sleepy Cheefin" RSVP not in inbox
  - Not found in any emails received or forwarded
  - May be in Resend but not yet forwarded by Pipedream
  - Need to manually trigger Pipedream to check for new submissions

- **Pipedream Data Store:** Tracks processed email IDs
  - If emails are in Resend but not forwarded, they may be marked as processed from a previous failed run
  - Can reset data store if needed

### 📝 Action Items Generated
- [ ] Send confirmation emails to 4 RSVP attendees
- [ ] Follow up with Ben Raker about unclear contact form
- [ ] Monitor dispensary email responses
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA to forms to prevent spam
- [ ] Test Pipedream with new form submission

### 🚨 CRITICAL ERROR FOUND AND FIXED

   - Slide 3: What to Expect - ALSO fixed content issues:
     - ✅ Removed "Bong Pong Tournament" (was replaced with Special K Ring Toss)

   - POST_01_DESIGN_SPECS.md (all instances)

### Postiz Scheduling Issue:
- **Problem:** Old scheduled post for arizona_smokers had Friday date + old images
- **Action:** User deleted old post and old images from Postiz
- **Attempted:** API upload of new corrected images - FAILED
- **Helpdesk Ticket:** Created TICKET_001_IMAGE_UPLOAD_API_ISSUE.md in `/postitz/helpdesk/`
- **Status:** Resolved via manual upload

- Cost: $0.00 (free tier)

### 🚨 Security Incident: OpenRouter API Key Exposed

- **Research:** Postiz agent found correct endpoint in /postitz/helpdesk/TICKET_001_RESOLUTION.md

- **SOJOURNER OUTREACH**: Requested on-camera interview for video content
- Keeping Dec 15 as toy drive cutoff (within their Dec 8-20 window)

  - Partners page (partners.html): Pitch deck with business data, demographics, testimonials
  - Strategy: Attendees never see corporate speak, partners get all the data they need
  - Partners page on hold pending design improvements

### Action Items:
1. **🚨 URGENT**: Schedule Ginza walkthrough to assess venue changes - Due: ASAP

  - Stage moved to accommodate new layout
  - Discussing if event is still viable at this location

- **Style:** 70s claymation Rudolph vibes

- **Next Step:** Walkthrough with photos, talk to Maggie ASAP

## QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

1. ✅ ~~**When is Sojourner Center's cutoff date for toy delivery?**~~ RESOLVED: Dec 8-20 window, our cutoff Dec 15
2. **Does Maggie approve the menu?** 🔴 CRITICAL
3. **Do we owe Special K money from last year?** 🟡 IMPORTANT
4. **What was the transportation issue?** 🟢 CLARIFY
5. **Where exactly are the vendor booth areas?** (Patio + dirt overflow)
6. **Do we have a target attendance number?**
7. **Who owns what in the content calendar?** (Gilbert, Speaker A, Dom split)

---

## RANDOM NOTES & IDEAS

- Nov 6 meeting mentioned "ramen addition" - what is this?
- Consider making Kanna Claus a recurring character (AI avatar?)
- Podcast could become annual tradition, not just KK6
- Glass blowers might form their own community through this
- Arizona glass community seems tight-knit, leverage that
- "All K's, no C's" branding is strong, lean into it
- Sojourner Center connection is personal - emphasize in storytelling
