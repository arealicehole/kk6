3. If no longer actively needed, consider moving to /archive

### When New Transcripts Arrive:

3. Extract decisions, tasks, contacts, dates from relevant transcripts
4. Update WORKING_NOTES.md with new daily entry

Here's some info about the kickback 

Here’s a clean, one-page description you can hand to anyone who’s never heard of it:

KannaKickback (by KannaKrew)

KannaKickback is KannaKrew’s annual holiday smoker’s party and community toy-drive. Launched in 2020, it’s now in its sixth year. The vibe is festive and cannabis-friendly—think KannaKlaus, elves, games, and lots of gifts and giveaways—while keeping the focus on doing real good together.

How the charity works: Starting with KannaKickback 3, the event became a toy-drive benefiting the Sojourner Center (a cause chosen because someone in the Krew was directly helped by them). Since then the impact has grown year over year: roughly $4,200 in toys at KK3, $5,500 at KK4, and $6,000–$6,500 at KK5. For KK6, the goal is to top that.

This year’s drive (KK6): The toy drive runs Nov 1 through all of November and the first week of December, culminating at the KannaKickback party. Donation boxes will be placed at community-favorite spots—dispensaries, smoke shops, and food joints—and KannaKrew will share content highlighting where to donate and who’s hosting boxes.

What it is at its core:
A growing, tradition-building celebration that rallies the KannaKrew and wider community each December—fun first, charity always—anchored by KannaKlaus, games, gifts, and a clear mission to make the holiday season better for families supported by the Sojourner Center.

How to plug in:

1. Drop a new, unwrapped toy at any participating box location.


2. Follow KannaKrew’s updates for box locations and event details.


3. Show up to KannaKickback and celebrate.



All K's, no C's: KannaKrew • KannaKickback • KannaKlaus.

## IMAGE GENERATION - CRITICAL RULE

**ALWAYS AND ONLY USE THE VISUAL-CREATOR SUBAGENT SYSTEM FOR IMAGE GENERATION**

- **Location:** C:\Users\figon\zeebot\.claude\agents\visual-creator\
- **How to use:** Invoke the Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose" and act as the coordinator agent
- **NEVER create Python scripts for image generation**
- **NEVER use Python scripts in /creative/social/images/ folders**
- **NEVER bypass the subagent system**

The visual-creator subagent system includes:
- Coordinator (orchestrates workflow)
- Content Parser (extracts design specs)
- Prompt Engineer (creates optimized prompts)
- Generator (calls OpenRouter API)
- Reviewer (quality control)

**Example invocation:**
```
Use the visual-creator subagent to regenerate slide 3 from POST_01_DESIGN_SPECS.md
```

This rule applies to ALL image generation tasks. No exceptions.

- when using postitz make sure u get confirmation about which account and also you use arizona time utc-7
- when you send emails default to send via resend unless otherwise directed
