# KannaKickback 6 Facebook Event & Group Strategy
**Complete Action Plan for Dec 6, 2025 Event**

**Created:** November 22, 2024
**Event Date:** December 6, 2025 (14 days away)
**Objective:** Activate Facebook Event Page & potentially Group for ad campaigns

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Use BOTH Facebook Event Page AND Facebook Group for maximum impact.

- **Event Page:** Handles logistics, RSVP tracking, broad reach, ad traffic destination
- **Facebook Group:** Builds community engagement, drives user-generated content, creates ongoing conversations

**The Strategy:** Event Page as the "front door" (public, discoverable, ad-optimized) + Private Group as the "living room" (community, engagement, donor recognition).

---

## SECTION 1: EVENT PAGE vs GROUP - WHICH TO USE?

### The Dual Strategy (Recommended)

**Use Both Together:**
- **Event Page:** For broadcasting information, RSVPs, logistics, ad traffic
- **Facebook Group:** For community interaction, daily engagement, donor spotlights

**Why Both?**
- Event Pages get better organic reach and discoverability
- Groups create deeper engagement and community (73% avg engagement rate for pages posting 1-2x daily)
- Event Pages work seamlessly with Facebook Ads
- Groups foster user-generated content and peer motivation

**Linking Strategy:**
- Pin Group invite link at top of Event Page
- Post Event Page updates in Group with "RSVP here" CTAs
- Cross-promote: "Join our Group for daily updates and behind-the-scenes"

### Event Page Strengths
- Public visibility and SEO
- RSVP tracking and conversion metrics
- Co-host feature (add Sojourner Center, vendors, box hosts as co-hosts)
- Native integration with Facebook Ads
- Appears on partners' pages when they accept co-host invites

### Group Strengths
- Many-to-many communication (members talk to each other)
- Higher engagement rates than Pages
- User-generated content hub (donor photos, box location visits)
- Gamification opportunities (leaderboards, challenges)
- Privacy options (closed groups foster belonging)

**DECISION:** Create Event Page (already exists) + NEW Private/Closed Group for KK6 community.

## SECTION 2: FACEBOOK EVENT PAGE OPTIMIZATION (TODAY)

### Cover Photo Specs & Best Practices

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Size:** 1920px wide x 1005px tall
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1.91:1
- **Quality:** High-resolution, no blur/pixelation

## SECTION 4: GAMIFICATION & DONOR RECOGNITION

### Gamification Tactics (2024-2025 Trends)

**1. Donation Leaderboard**
- Track top donors (by quantity or value)
- Weekly updates in Group: "This week's MVPs"
- Grand prize for #1 donor at event
- **Engagement Boost:** Leaderboards create social motivation and friendly competition

**2. Digital Badges & Recognition**
- "First Donor" badge
- "Box Scout" badge (visited 3+ donation locations)
- "Community Champion" badge (referred 3+ friends who donated)
- Post badge graphics in Group when members earn them

**3. Photo Challenge Contest**
- **Challenge:** "Post a photo at a donation box location + tag KannaKrew"
- **Prizes:** Entry into raffle for vendor prizes (bongs, merch, etc.)
- **Result:** User-generated content you can repost
- **Why It Works:** UGC is 8.7x more impactful than influencer content

**4. Milestone Celebrations**
- "100 toys donated! Let's hit 200 by Sunday!"
- Progress bars showing goal achievement
- Unlock perks at milestones: "At 500 toys, we'll announce a surprise guest!"

**5. Team Challenges**
- "North Phoenix vs South Phoenix - who donates more?"
- Dispensary vs Smoke Shop challenge
- Friendly competition among box host locations

### Donor Recognition Strategy

**Individual Shoutouts:**
- Daily "Donor of the Day" post in Group
- Feature photo of donor + their toy donation
- Personal thank-you message
- Tag them (if they consent)

**Batch Recognition:**
- Weekly recap: "This week's amazing donors!"
- Grid of donor photos/names
- Total toys collected that week

**Vendor/Partner Recognition:**
- "Box Host Spotlight" series
- Thank vendor partners publicly
- Share their business info (cross-promotion)

**Event Day Recognition:**

- "Hall of Fame" display at event
- Social media shoutouts during party

**Why Recognition Matters:**
- Gamification satisfies desire for challenge AND recognition
- Virtual rewards enhance sense of accomplishment
- Recognition builds long-term advocates (not one-time donors)

## SECTION 5: FACEBOOK ADS INTEGRATION

### Pre-Ad Optimization (Do This First)

**Event Page Checklist:**
- [ ] Cover photo optimized (1920x1005, high-quality, date/location visible)
- [ ] First paragraph of description is compelling (shows first)
- [ ] Clear CTA in description ("RSVP now and bring a toy!")

- [ ] At least 5-10 organic posts already on page (shows activity)

**Group Checklist:**
- [ ] Group created and description optimized
- [ ] Welcome post pinned
- [ ] Group rules clear and visible
- [ ] 10-20 initial members seeded (invite KannaKrew core)
- [ ] 3-5 posts already live (shows active community)
- [ ] Moderators assigned and briefed

**Why Pre-Optimize?**
- Ad traffic judges your event in 3 seconds
- Empty or inactive pages = immediate bounce
- First impression determines RSVP conversion rate

**Sources:**

- [Facebook Ad Optimization Checklist 2025](https://madgicx.com/blog/facebook-ad-optimization)

### Ad Campaign Structure

**Campaign Goal:** Event Responses (RSVP optimization)

**Two-Stage Strategy:**

**Stage 1: Awareness + Event RSVPs (Nov 22-28)**
- **Objective:** Get the word out, drive Event Page RSVPs
- **Audience:** Broad targeting (Phoenix, 21+, interests: cannabis, music festivals, community events)
- **Ad Format:** Video or carousel showcasing KannaKlaus, past events, Sojourner Center mission
- **CTA:** "RSVP to KannaKickback 6"
- **Landing:** Event Page (optimized for RSVPs)
- **Metric:** Cost per Event Response (cheapest RSVPs)

**Stage 2: Conversion + Retargeting (Nov 29 - Dec 5)**
- **Objective:** Convert RSVPs to actual attendees + Group members
- **Audience:** People who RSVP'd to event OR engaged with ads/page
- **Ad Format:** Testimonials, countdown graphics, "Last chance" urgency
- **CTA:** "Join the Group for exclusive updates" OR "Don't forget: Dec 6!"
- **Landing:** Group invite link OR Event Page
- **Metric:** ROAS (return on ad spend via event attendance/donations)

**Ad Creative Best Practices:**
- First 3 seconds: Hook with KannaKlaus or surprising stat ("$20K in toys donated since 2020!")
- Emotive language to evoke excitement
- Clear CTA in first frame
- Include event date/location in ad copy
- Use eye-catching visuals that stop scrolling

- [How to Promote Events on Facebook 2025](https://time.ly/blog/how-to-promote-events-on-facebook-essential-guide/)

### Targeting Strategy

**Core Audience (Broad):**
- **Location:** Phoenix metro area (25-mile radius)
- **Age:** 21-45 (Arizona legal cannabis age + target demo)
- **Interests:** Cannabis, 420, music festivals, community service, local events, toys for tots

**Lookalike Audiences:**
- Create from: KannaKrew Facebook Page followers
- Create from: Past event attendees (KK3, KK4, KK5)
- Create from: Website visitors (if pixel installed)

**Retargeting Audiences:**
- People who RSVP'd "Interested" or "Going" (high-priority)
- People who engaged with Event Page in last 30 days
- People who engaged with ads but didn't RSVP
- Group members (drive to event attendance)

**Exclusions:**
- People under 21 (compliance)
- People who already RSVP'd "Going" (focus budget on new reach)

### What Ad Traffic Expects (Landing Page Optimization)

**When Someone Clicks Your Ad, They Expect:**
1. **Immediate clarity:** "What is this event?"
2. **Visual consistency:** Ad creative matches Event Page cover
3. **Easy action:** One-click RSVP, no friction
4. **Social proof:** Other people already attending (show RSVP count)
5. **Logistical details:** Date, time, location, what to bring

**Event Page = Your Landing Page**
- Cover photo should mirror ad creative (visual consistency)
- First paragraph visible without scrolling (no "see more" click)
- RSVP button prominent
- Pinned post reinforces CTA from ad

**Group = Secondary Conversion**
- Mention Group in Event Page pinned post
- Invite RSVPs to join Group for "exclusive updates"
- Group becomes your retargeting pool for future KK events

## SECTION 6: CANNABIS COMPLIANCE (CRITICAL)

### Facebook's Cannabis Policy (2024)

**What's Allowed:**
- ✅ Community events that happen to be cannabis-themed
- ✅ Promoting event attendance (no product sales)
- ✅ Educational content about cannabis culture
- ✅ CBD/hemp product promotion (WITH Meta approval + LegitScript certification)
- ✅ Highlighting dispensary involvement in community events

**What's BANNED:**
- ❌ Selling, trading, or facilitating delivery of THC products
- ❌ Direct promotions, discounts, or sales pitches for cannabis products
- ❌ Implying products are for sale at event
- ❌ Advertising cannabis products (even if legal in AZ)
- ❌ Allowing minors to view cannabis-related content

**Arizona-Specific Restrictions:**
- Cannabis businesses can promote their BRAND but NOT products
- Event promotion is allowed (as long as 21+ only)
- Private social media accounts must state followers should be 21+
- No billboards, TV, radio ads for cannabis products (but events are different)

**Sources:**

- [Social Media Guidelines for Cannabis Marketers (PDF)](https://thecannabisindustry.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social_Guildelines_for_Cannabis_Marketers_FINAL.pdf)

### KannaKickback 6 Compliance Strategy

**Messaging Framework:**
- **Lead with charity:** "Phoenix's biggest holiday toy drive"
- **Cannabis as culture, not product:** "Cannabis-friendly community event"
- **Emphasize inclusivity:** "All adults 21+ welcome"
- **Focus on celebration:** "Holiday party meets community impact"

**Language to Use:**
- "Cannabis-friendly event"
- "KannaKrew community"
- "420-friendly celebration"
- "Adult holiday party"

**Language to Avoid:**
- "Buy cannabis at our event" (NEVER)
- "Weed for sale"
- "Dispensary deals" (focus on their community support instead)
- Any implication of product sales/trades

**Vendor Partner Posts:**
- ✅ "Thank you [Dispensary Name] for hosting a donation box!"
- ✅ "[Vendor] is donating prizes for KK6 attendees!"
- ❌ "Get 20% off cannabis products at [Dispensary]!"

**Age-Gating:**
- Event Page: Set to 21+ in event settings
- Group: State in description "Must be 21+ to join (Arizona law)"
- Ads: Target 21+ only (no exceptions)
- Posts: Avoid content that appeals to minors

**Account Safety:**
- Don't use KannaKrew's main account to directly sell products
- Keep event promotion separate from any product commerce
- If ad account gets flagged, appeal with: "This is a charity toy drive event, not cannabis sales"

**Balancing Cannabis Brand + Mainstream Appeal:**
- KannaKlaus = cannabis branding (fun, recognizable)
- Sojourner Center = mainstream charity (family-friendly)
- Messaging: "Come for the cannabis culture, stay for the community impact"

## SECTION 11: CANNABIS COMMUNITY + MAINSTREAM DONOR BALANCE

### The Tightrope: Cannabis Culture + Family-Friendly Charity

**Challenge:** Appeal to cannabis enthusiasts (your core community) WITHOUT alienating mainstream donors who care about Sojourner Center mission.

**Solution:** Layered messaging strategy.

### Messaging Layer 1: Cannabis Community (Primary Audience)

**Channels:**
- Facebook Group (cannabis-friendly space)
- KannaKrew main social accounts
- Direct outreach to dispensaries/smoke shops

**Tone:**
- Cannabis references, 420 culture
- KannaKlaus character (weed-themed Santa)
- Insider language ("KannaKrew", "the Krew", "420-friendly")

**Messaging:**
- "The cannabis community gives back"
- "Come for the culture, stay for the impact"
- "Phoenix stoners showing up for families"

**Visual Branding:**
- KannaKlaus imagery
- Green color palette
- Cannabis leaf motifs (subtle, not overt)

### Messaging Layer 2: Mainstream Donors (Secondary Audience)

**Channels:**
- Event Page description (first paragraph)
- Sojourner Center cross-promotion
- Media outreach (if any)

**Tone:**
- Community-focused, inclusive
- Emphasize charity impact over cannabis culture
- Family-friendly language

**Messaging:**
- "Phoenix's annual holiday toy drive"
- "Community celebration supporting local families"
- "Adult party meets charitable giving"

**Visual Branding:**
- Sojourner Center logo prominent
- Toy donation imagery
- Holiday themes (inclusive, not overly cannabis-focused)

### The Hybrid Approach (Event Page + Ads)

**Event Page Cover Photo:**
- KannaKlaus front and center (cannabis community knows)
- "+ Sojourner Center" logo (mainstream knows it's legit charity)
- "Holiday Toy Drive" text (clear charitable purpose)

**Event Description First Paragraph:**
```
KannaKickback 6 is Phoenix's favorite holiday party and community toy drive! Join us Dec 6 for games, prizes, and the biggest toy donation reveal of the year—all benefiting the Sojourner Center. Since 2020, we've donated $20K+ in toys to Phoenix families. This year we're going even BIGGER. RSVP now, bring a toy, celebrate community. 🎁
```
(Notice: Cannabis-friendly implied, not stated outright)

**Ad Creative Strategy:**
- Ad Version A (Cannabis Community): KannaKlaus-heavy, "KannaKrew" branding
- Ad Version B (Mainstream): Sojourner Center-focused, "holiday toy drive" angle
- Target Ad A to cannabis-interest audiences
- Target Ad B to broader charity/community interest audiences

### Box Host Messaging Guidance

**For Dispensary/Smoke Shop Hosts:**
```
[Dispensary Name] is proud to host a KannaKickback donation box! Drop off new, unwrapped toys for Phoenix families supported by the Sojourner Center. The cannabis community gives back. 💚🎁

Donation box open through Dec 6. Party details: [Event Page link]
```

**For Mainstream Hosts (Restaurants, etc.):**
```
[Restaurant Name] is supporting the KannaKickback toy drive benefiting the Sojourner Center! Stop by and donate a new, unwrapped toy for a family in need this holiday season. 🎁

Donation box open through Dec 6. Event info: [link]
```

**Result:** Each audience sees the message that resonates with them, but everyone contributes to the same cause.

---

## SECTION 12: HANDLING NEGATIVE COMMENTS & TROLLS

### Comment Moderation Strategy

**Negative Comment Types + Responses:**

**Type 1: "This is promoting drug use!"**
Response:
```
KannaKickback is a community event celebrating cannabis culture (legal in Arizona for adults 21+) while supporting the Sojourner Center's mission to help Phoenix families. Our focus is on charitable giving and bringing people together. Since 2020, we've donated $20K+ in toys. We'd love for you to join us in making a difference! 🎁
```

**Type 2: "Why would you mix weed and charity?"**
Response:
```
Great question! The cannabis community is incredibly generous and community-oriented. KannaKickback proves that fun and philanthropy go hand-in-hand. Our attendees have donated thousands of toys over the years, directly benefiting families supported by the Sojourner Center. Different communities give back in different ways—this is ours! 💚
```

**Type 3: "This is inappropriate for kids."**
Response:
```
KannaKickback is an adult event (21+ only) with a charitable mission. While the party is cannabis-friendly, the toy donations go to children through the Sojourner Center, a respected Phoenix nonprofit. We take both our community culture and our charitable impact seriously. Thank you for your concern!
```

**Type 4: Spam/Solicitation**
Action:
- Delete immediately
- Ban user if repeat offender
- Do NOT engage

**Type 5: "I reported this event for promoting drugs."**
Response:
```
We understand cannabis can be a sensitive topic. To clarify: KannaKickback does not sell or facilitate the sale of any cannabis products. We're hosting a community toy drive and celebration for adults 21+, which is fully compliant with Facebook's policies and Arizona law. Our focus is on supporting the Sojourner Center and bringing the community together. If you have questions, feel free to DM us directly. ✌️
```

### Moderation Workflow

**In Event Page:**
- Monitor comments 2x daily (morning + evening)
- Respond to questions within 24 hours
- Hide (don't delete) borderline negative comments
- Delete only: spam, hate speech, or clear policy violations

**In Group:**
- Moderators monitor throughout the day
- Address negativity quickly (within 2-4 hours)
- Private message repeat offenders before banning
- Ban criteria: Hate speech, harassment, repeated spam, product sales attempts

**Escalation Protocol:**
1. First offense: Public response (polite, informative)
2. Second offense: Private message warning
3. Third offense: Remove from Group / hide from Event
4. Persistent issues: Ban + report to Facebook if needed

### Turning Negativity into Opportunity

**Example:**
Negative comment: "Why are you mixing drugs and charity?"

Public response:
```
We're glad you're here! KannaKickback isn't about drugs—it's about community. The cannabis community in Phoenix is passionate, generous, and ready to make an impact. Since 2020, we've donated $20K+ in toys to families through the Sojourner Center. If you're interested in supporting Phoenix families, we'd love to have you join us! Bring a toy, see the impact firsthand. 🎁
```

Private follow-up (optional):
- DM the person: "Hey, we saw your comment and wanted to reach out personally..."
- Explain mission
- Invite them to learn more about Sojourner Center
- Offer to answer questions

**Result:** Some skeptics become supporters when they see genuine charitable intent.

---

## SECTION 13: LONG-TERM COMMUNITY BUILDING (POST-KK6)

### What Happens After Dec 6?

**Option 1: Archive the Group**
- Leave it active but lower posting frequency
- Use for KK7 planning announcements throughout 2026
- Keep members engaged sporadically (1x/month)

**Option 2: Evolve into Year-Round KannaKrew Group**
- Rebrand to "KannaKrew Community - Phoenix"
- Post regularly about cannabis culture, local events, community service
- Use as hub for ALL KannaKrew initiatives (not just KK)
- Build towards KK7 with consistent engagement

**Recommended:** Option 2 (Year-Round Group)

**Why?**
- Keeps community warm for next year
- Builds long-term relationships (not transactional)
- Creates ongoing value for members
- Easier to reactivate for KK7 (members already there)

### Year-Round Content Strategy (Post-KK6)

**Dec 7 - Jan 31 (Post-Event Glow):**
- Share KK6 photos/videos
- Final donation total + impact story
- Thank-you posts for donors/partners
- Member spotlights
- Frequency: 2-3x/week

**Feb - Oct (Low Engagement Phase):**
- Cannabis culture content (news, memes, education)
- Local Phoenix events (concerts, markets, etc.)
- Community member spotlights
- Occasional "throwback" KK posts
- Frequency: 1x/week

**Nov 1 - Dec 6 (KK7 Ramp-Up):**
- Reactivate with KK7 announcement
- Return to daily posting
- Repeat KK6 playbook with improvements

### Retention Strategies

**Keep Members Engaged:**
- Monthly themed posts ("Member Monday" - spotlight a community member)
- Quarterly contests/giveaways (vendor partnerships)
- Annual KK planning polls ("What should KK7 look like?")
- Value-add content (cannabis event calendar, local business discounts)

**Leverage for Future Events:**
- KK7 early bird announcements
- Exclusive Group perks (early RSVP, VIP tickets, etc.)
- Group members become ambassadors (they recruit new donors)

**Measure Success:**
- Retention rate: How many KK6 members stay active through 2026?
- Engagement rate: Does it stay above 50% with lower posting frequency?
- Conversion rate: When KK7 launches, how many Group members RSVP immediately?

**Goal:** By KK7, you have a 500+ member active Group that's ready to mobilize instantly.
