# FACEBOOK STRATEGY FOR KK6 - REFINED & ACTIONABLE

**Created:** 2025-11-22
**Event Date:** Dec 6, 2025 (14 days away)
**Current Event:** https://www.facebook.com/events/1842338499738088

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDING: NO API ACCESS FOR FACEBOOK EVENTS

**Facebook Events API is DEAD (deprecated Sep 2023)**
- ❌ Cannot create/update events via API
- ❌ Cannot post to event page programmatically
- ❌ Postiz does NOT support Facebook Events
- ✅ ONLY manual posting through Facebook web interface works

**What This Means:**
- All event updates must be posted manually
- No automation via Postiz or any other tool
- Pre-write content, then copy/paste manually
- Use Postiz for Facebook Page posts only (not Event posts)

---

## 📊 CURRENT EVENT STATUS (As of Nov 22)

**Event Details:**
- **Title:** "Holiday TOY DRIVE -Kanna Kickback 6"
- **Date/Time:** Saturday, December 6, 2025 at 2:00 PM – 6:00 PM MST
- **Location:** Ginza Gold Canyon, 8654 E Topaz Dr., Gold Canyon
- **Attendees:** 27 people responded
- **Type:** Public event
- **Host:** Kanna Krew

**Current Description:**
```
🎄✨ KANNA KICKBACK 6 IS BACK ✨🎄

Year 6 of the Valley's favorite holiday smoker's party + charity toy drive!

📅 SATURDAY, DECEMBER 6TH
⏰ 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM
📍 ... (truncated with "See more" link)
```

**What's Good:**
- ✅ Event page exists and is active
- ✅ Public visibility
- ✅ Clear date/time/location
- ✅ 27 RSVPs already (building momentum)

**What Needs Work:**
- ⚠️ Description cuts off (needs full info visible)
- ⚠️ No recent updates posted to event
- ⚠️ Missing key info in description (donation boxes, vendors, what to bring)

---

## 🎯 REFINED STRATEGY (What You CAN Do)

### Your Facebook Assets:
1. **Facebook Event Page** (manual posting only)
2. **Kanna Krew Facebook Page** (Postiz-compatible)
3. **Kanna Krew Group** (existing but inactive - can revive)
4. **AZ Smoker/Event Groups** (you're a member - can post in)

### Recommended Workflow:

#### **Option A: Event Page + Facebook Page (Simple)**
- Post updates manually to Event Page
- Use Postiz to schedule Page posts that link to Event
- Share Page posts to Event timeline
- Post in AZ groups with Event link

#### **Option B: Event Page + Revive Kanna Krew Group (Moderate)**
- Keep Event Page as RSVP hub
- Revive Kanna Krew Group for daily engagement
- Link Event to Group
- Post updates in both places

#### **Option C: Event Page + AZ Groups Cross-Posting (Maximum Reach)**
- Focus on Event Page for core updates
- Cross-post to AZ smoker/event groups you're in
- Leverage existing communities
- Drive traffic back to Event

**RECOMMENDATION:** Combo of A + C
- Simple, maximum reach, leverages existing communities
- No need to create/revive another group this close to event
