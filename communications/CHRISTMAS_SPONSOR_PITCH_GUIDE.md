# KannaKickback 6 - Christmas Sponsor Pitch Guide

**Created:** November 29, 2025
**Purpose:** Pitch deck and talking points for recruiting sponsors and vendors
**Target:** Dispensaries, cannabis brands, glass vendors, ancillary businesses
**Event Date:** December 6, 2025 (Saturday, 2-6 PM)

---

## THE HOOK: 19 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS EXPOSURE

**KK6 is December 6. Christmas is December 25. That's 19 days of prime holiday content.**

When you sponsor KannaKickback 6, you're not just getting 4 hours of event exposure. You're getting:

- **Pre-event content** (Dec 1-5): Daily countdown posts featuring sponsors
- **Event day coverage** (Dec 6): Live social media, photos, videos with your brand
- **Post-event content** (Dec 7-25): Recap posts, thank-you features, Christmas content tie-ins
- **2026 promotional materials**: Your logo in next year's "Our Sponsors" content

**Total potential exposure: 19+ days of Christmas-themed cannabis content**

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

### Why Christmas + Cannabis = Untapped Gold

The research shows:
- **December sees 10-20% sales uplift** for cannabis dispensaries
- **December 23rd is the #1 cannabis sales day** of the entire year
- **Holiday email campaigns get 48% higher open rates**
- **SMS has 98% open rate** (perfect for event reminders)

**But here's the gap:** Almost no cannabis brands do holiday-themed charity events.

KannaKickback is THE cannabis toy drive. 6th year running. $20,000+ in toys donated to date. Growing year over year.

**You'd be associating your brand with:**
- ✅ Community charity (positive PR)
- ✅ Holiday warmth (KannaKlaus mascot)
- ✅ Local Arizona culture (East Valley roots)
- ✅ Cannabis normalization (fun, family-adjacent)

### Sojourner Center Validation

> "You've outdone corporations." - Seren, Sojourner Center Community Engagement Manager

The Sojourner Center is Arizona's largest domestic violence shelter. They've specifically told us KannaKrew donations are MORE impactful than corporate donations because we provide gifts for the "forgotten" ages (teens 13-17).

### Follow-Up (If No Response After 3 Days)

**Subject:** Re: KannaKickback 6 - Quick Question

Hey [NAME],

Just circling back on the KK6 sponsorship. Event is Dec 6 (1 week out) so we're locking in sponsors now.

Quick question: Would hosting a donation box work for you? Zero cost - just counter space for a toy drop-off box. We handle pickup.

You'd get listed on our website + social shoutouts as a community partner.

Let me know either way so I can update our list.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]

### In-Person Pitch (At Shop/Event)

**Opening:**
"Hey! I'm [NAME] from KannaKrew. We run KannaKickback - it's a toy drive for Sojourner Center. December 6th is our event. Are you guys doing anything for the holidays?"

**The Hook:**
"We're looking for spots to put donation boxes. Zero cost - just need counter space. You'd get listed on our website and social media as a community partner."

**If Interested:**
"Perfect! Can I leave a box here? It's just for toys - we pick them up December 15th. And if you want to come to the event, it's at Ginza in Gold Canyon. Free entry."

**Close:**
"What's the best email to send you details? And do you want me to tag your Instagram when we post about your location?"

## CHRISTMAS CONTENT ANGLES

### The 19-Day Play

Since KK6 is Dec 6 and Christmas is Dec 25, sponsors get nearly 3 weeks of content:

1. **"X Days Until Christmas" countdown** (Dec 6-25) - Feature sponsors daily
2. **"KannaKlaus Delivers" series** - KannaKlaus mascot poses with sponsor products
3. **Holiday gift guides** - "Last-minute cannabis gifts from our KK6 sponsors"
4. **Christmas morning content** - "Merry Christmas from KannaKrew + [Sponsors]"
5. **New Year content** - "2025 wrapped: Thank you to our KK6 sponsors"

### The Darwin Opportunity

Research found **Darwin**, an Arizona cannabis brand with a lion mascot. They made a "splash at MJ Unpacked in Vegas."

**Potential pitch:**
"Darwin x KannaKlaus collaboration for KK6 and/or KK7. Two mascots, one community."

This could be a major partnership opportunity for 2026.
