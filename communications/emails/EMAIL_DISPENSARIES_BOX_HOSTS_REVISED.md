## EMAIL VERSION 1: FORMAL

**Subject:** KannaKickback Toy Drive - Continue Partnership?

Hi [Name/Team],

Hope you've been well! Last year, you partnered with us and Tom's Palms for our KannaKickback toy drive benefiting the Sojourner Center. Tammy shared your contact info with us because Tom's Palms isn't able to do a holiday drive this year, and we'd love to continue the partnership with you directly.

**Quick Recap:**
- We're KannaKrew, running our 6th annual KannaKickback
- Our toy drive has grown every year (last year: ~$6,000-6,500 in toys)
- This year's drive runs **Nov 15 - Dec 15**
- All toys go to Sojourner Center families

**What We're Asking:**
We'd love to place a festive donation box at [Your Location] again.

**What We Provide:**
- Festive donation box with signage
- Promotional materials and social media assets
- Partnership recognition at the event
- Zero cost to you
- Scheduled pickup on Dec 15

**Optional Add-Ons:**
Some dispensaries that we've worked with have offered a free pre-roll with each toy donation in the past. This is totally optional, but it was a great customer incentive!

You can also share this on your social channels and encourage customers to donate new, unwrapped toys.

**Next Steps:**
If you're interested, just reply with:
1. Confirmed store address + contact person
2. Preferred delivery window for the box

We can also discuss vendor booth opportunities at the actual KannaKickback event (Dec 6, Gold Canyon) - no booth fees, just bring your vibes and products.

Thanks for supporting the community with us!

## EMAIL VERSION 2: CASUAL/DM STYLE

**Subject:** KK6 Toy Drive - Partner Again?

Hey [Name],

It's Gilbert with KannaKrew! Last year you worked with us and Tom's Palms on the toy drive. Since Tom's isn't doing a holiday drive this year, we wanted to reach out directly and see if you'd want to continue the partnership.

We're running the same toy drive (benefiting Sojourner Center) from **Nov 15 - Dec 15**. Last year we hit ~$6k in toys, trying to beat that this year.

Can we drop a festive donation box at [Location] again?

**We handle:**
- Box + signage
- Social media assets
- Pickup on Dec 15

**You can:**
- Share on your socials
- Encourage customers to donate unwrapped toys
- (Optional) Offer free pre-roll with donations like some spots did last year

If you're down, just let me know your preferred delivery time for the box!

Also - if you want to set up a booth at the actual kickback event (Dec 6, Gold Canyon), no booth fees. Just vibes and products.

Let me know!

## SMS/DM VERSION (ULTRA SHORT)

Yo! It's Gilbert w/ KannaKrew. We did the toy drive with you & Tom's Palms last year. Tom's isn't doing it this year so we're reaching out direct. Can we drop a toy box at [Location] again? Nov 15-Dec 15, we handle the box/signage/pickup. Same deal as last year. Down? 🎁

✅ Changed to "unwrapped toys"
✅ Sign as Gilbert Trout (not Figueroa)
✅ Separated vendor booth pitch (optional add-on)
✅ Changed tagline to "It's not just cannabis, it's culture"
