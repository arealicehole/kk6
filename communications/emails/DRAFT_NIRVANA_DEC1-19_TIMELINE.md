## Email Body:

Hey Max,

This is amazing - we're absolutely stoked to have all 9 of your locations on board! Having Nirvana Center as our major partner across the valley is going to make a huge impact for the Sojourner Center families.

**All 9 locations confirmed:**
- Backpackboyz AZ
- 7th Street
- 75th Ave
- Prescott Valley
- Florence
- Apache Junction
- Cookies Tempe
- North Phoenix
- Tucson

We're pumped about the pre-roll for toy donation promo - that was a huge success last year and we're excited to run it again!

**One small adjustment on timing:** Our delivery window to Sojourner Center closes December 20th, so we'd need to ask if you could run the promo **December 1-19** instead of through the 22nd. This gives us time to pick up all the boxes on the 19th and get everything delivered to Sojourner on the 20th. Would that work for your team?

We're planning to start delivering boxes this week. Could you let us know which locations would be easiest to hit first? We want to coordinate with each store manager to make sure it's convenient for them.

Looking forward to making this the biggest toy drive yet!
