### FOR CHILL PIPE

Hey [Contact at Chill Pipe],

[Your Name] from KannaKrew - hope you've been good!

KannaKickback 6 is happening Friday, December 6th (2-6pm at Ginza in Gold Canyon) and I'm reaching out because you CRUSHED it for us last year.

You donated 30 bongs for our Bong Pong game last year and people went absolutely crazy for it. We're running the same setup this year and would love to have you back.

**What I'm asking:**
- Same deal as last year: 30 bongs for Bong Pong tournament
- Vendor booth at the event (no fee, just show up)
- We'll blast your brand across all our social media (15+ posts, thousands of reach)

**What's new this year:**
- We're going for $7,000+ in toy donations (beat our $6,500 from last year)
- Bigger vendor lineup (10 booths)
- More content/clips (we're doing a podcast series too)

You in? Let me know ASAP so I can get you confirmed.

Also - if you can't do the full 30 bongs, even 15-20 would be awesome. We're flexible.

Thanks for always supporting the Krew 🙏

### FOR SPECIAL K

Hey [Contact at Special K],

[Your Name] from KannaKrew. First off - I want to address something upfront.

I know we might owe you payment from last year's Kickback. You gave us 20 bongs and absolutely showed up for the community. If there's something we need to square up, let's talk about it - I want to make sure you're taken care of.

**That said:**

KK6 is happening Dec 6th and I'd love to have you back. Last year was huge (you were a big part of that) and this year we're going even bigger.

Can we hop on a quick call to:
1. Clear up any payment stuff from last year
2. Talk about how you want to be involved this year

You've been down with us since the beginning and I don't want any weirdness. Let's just handle it.
