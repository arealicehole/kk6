## EMAIL 1: NIRVANA CENTER

**To:** Max Schell • max@nirvanacenter.com
**Subject:** KannaKickback 6 - Let's Continue the Toy Drive 🎄

Hey Max,

Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out from KannaKrew about our 6th annual KannaKickback toy drive.

We worked with you last year through Tom's Palms to place donation boxes and run the toy drive. Unfortunately, Tom's Palms can't lead this year due to personal reasons, but we want to keep this going and continue the partnership we had with Nirvana Center.

**Quick background:**
Last year we donated $6,500 in toys to the Sojourner Center. The sad reality is that many families in crisis have to leave quickly with nothing, and their kids often get forgotten in the chaos. These toys help make sure those kids still have something to open during the holidays. This is year 6, and we're aiming for $7,000+ this year.

**Here's what we're asking:**

We'd love to place a donation box at Nirvana Center again this year. Here's the setup:

✅ **What you get:**
- Free marketing exposure on our social media (15+ posts reaching thousands)
- Foot traffic from toy donors coming to your location
- Community goodwill and local press coverage
- Partnership recognition at the Dec 6th event
- Zero cost to you

✅ **What we provide:**
- Festive donation box with signage and promotional materials
- Social media assets you can use

✅ **The timeline:**
- **Box placement:** Week of Nov 11-15
- **Collection period:** Nov 15 - Dec 15, 2025 (exactly 1 month)
- **Box pickup:** Dec 15-16 (we handle it)
- **Event:** Dec 6, 2-6pm at Ginza in Gold Canyon

✅ **What we ask:**
- Host a donation box at your front counter/lobby
- Share on your social media
- Encourage customers to donate new, unwrapped toys
- *(Optional: Some dispensaries we worked with last year offered a free pre-roll with each toy donation - Nirvana did this and customers loved it!)*

**Interested in continuing this year?**

Let me know ASAP and I'll get you on the list. We're confirming locations this week.

Also - if you want to take it a step further and set up a vendor booth at the actual Kickback event on Dec 6th, let's talk about that too. No booth fees, just bring your vibes and products.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully we can make KK6 the biggest one yet together.

**Fun first. Charity always.**
