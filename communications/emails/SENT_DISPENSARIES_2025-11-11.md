## EMAIL 1: NIRVANA CENTER

**To:** Max Schell • max@nirvanacenter.com
**Subject:** Partner with KannaKickback 6 - Host a Toy Drive Box 🎄

Hey Max,

Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out from KannaKrew about our 6th annual KannaKickback - the East Valley's favorite holiday smoker's party and charity toy drive.

**Quick recap if you're new to us:**
- KannaKickback is our annual December party + toy drive benefiting the Sojourner Center
- We've grown from $4,200 in toys (KK3) to $6,500 last year (KK5)
- This year we're going for $7,000+ and we'd love Nirvana Center's help

**Here's where you come in:**

We're placing 10-15 donation boxes across the East Valley and would love to have one at Nirvana Center. Here's what that looks like:

✅ **What you get:**
- Free marketing exposure on our social media (15+ posts reaching thousands)
- Foot traffic from toy donors coming to your location
- Community goodwill and local press coverage
- Partnership recognition at the Dec 6th event
- Zero cost to you

✅ **What we provide:**
- Branded donation box (KannaKlaus design - festive and fun)
- All signage and promotional materials
- Social media assets you can share
- Pre-rolls to give away with toy donations (optional, like last year)

✅ **The timeline:**
- **Box placement:** Week of Nov 11-15
- **Collection period:** Nov 15 - Dec 15, 2025 (exactly 1 month)
- **Box pickup:** Dec 15-16 (we handle it)
- **Event:** Dec 6, 2-6pm at Ginza in Gold Canyon

✅ **What we ask:**
- Host a donation box at your front counter/lobby
- Share on your social media (we'll provide the content)
- Encourage customers to donate new, unwrapped toys
- Optional: Offer pre-rolls with toy donations (we supply them)

**The impact:**
Every toy goes to the Sojourner Center to help local families during the holidays. This is year 6, and we're building a real tradition in the East Valley cannabis community.

**Interested?**

Let me know ASAP and I'll get you on the list. We're confirming locations this week and want to make sure Nirvana Center is part of this.

Also - if you want to take it a step further and set up a vendor booth at the actual Kickback event on Dec 6th, let's talk about that too. No booth fees, just bring your vibes and products.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully we can make KK6 the biggest one yet together.

**Fun first. Charity always.**
