## MESSAGE

Yo! KannaKickback 6 is happening Dec 6th and we'd love to have you back.

Last year you blessed us with 20 bongs and absolutely showed up for the community. This year we're going bigger and would love your support again.

**What we're asking for:**
- 20-30 pieces total (we'll take whatever you can bless us with though)
  - 10 for ring toss game
  - 10 for prizes/giveaways
  - 10 for people to smoke out of at the event

**What you get:**
- Heavy social media promo (15+ posts, thousands of reach)
- Vendor booth at the event (no fee)
- Recognition at the party
- Good karma + community love

Also - real talk: if there's any payment stuff we need to square up from last year, let's handle that. You've been down with us since the beginning and I want to make sure you're taken care of.

You in? Let me know ASAP so we can lock you into the lineup.

**Dec 6, 2-6pm at Ginza in Gold Canyon**
