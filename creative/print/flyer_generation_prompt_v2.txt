Create a CLEAN, MINIMAL, PROFESSIONAL vertical event flyer (1080x1350px, 4:5 aspect ratio) for KannaKickback 6 charity event.

CRITICAL FIXES FOR THIS VERSION:
1. Make KannaKlaus graphic even MORE SIMPLE and MINIMAL - we need cleaner, less wild graphics overall
2. Fix "How to Participate" section with CORRECT text for each step

**HEADER SECTION (Top 20%):**
- "KANNA KICKBACK 6" in huge, bold, festive letters (primary headline)
- Subtitle below: "Year 6. Let's make it legendary."

=== STYLE & COMPOSITION ===

Layout principles:
- EXTREMELY CLEAN and MINIMAL - this is the priority
- 35-40% white space throughout - give it room to breathe
- Each section clearly separated with generous spacing
- Professional, elegant charity event aesthetic
- Clear visual hierarchy - less is more
- Vertical flow guides eye from top to bottom naturally
- NO busy or overwhelming graphics anywhere

Typography:
- All section titles: BOLD and clearly larger than body text
- Body text: Clean, readable size (nothing under 14pt equivalent)
- Generous line spacing in all sections
- "KANNA KICKBACK 6" is the largest text on flyer
- All text easily readable at both print size and mobile screen
- Simple, elegant fonts - nothing too decorative

KannaKlaus graphic specifications (UPDATED - MORE MINIMAL):
- TINY icon size (8-10% of header area MAXIMUM)
- Ultra-simple design: Just a basic Santa hat outline with one tiny leaf
- Think minimalist logo, NOT a character
- NOT wild, NOT busy, NOT overwhelming
- Should be almost an afterthought - barely there
- Complement the text, don't compete with it

Decorative elements (KEEP MINIMAL):
- A FEW small cannabis leaf snowflakes or ornaments as background accents
- VERY minimal and tasteful - barely noticeable
- Should fade into background
- Professional charity aesthetic is priority

=== COLOR PALETTE ===

Primary colors:
- Forest green: #2C5F2D (for titles, accents)
- Holiday red: #C41E3A (for festive accents)
- Gold: #D4AF37 (for special highlights)
- Cream: #FFF8DC (background)

Color usage:
- Clean cream background for maximum readability
- Forest green for main titles and borders
- Holiday red for festive accents (use sparingly)
- Gold for special emphasis (mission section, CTA)
- High contrast between text and background
- Lots of cream/white showing - don't fill every space
