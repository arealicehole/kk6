# KannaKickback 6 Event Flyer - REVISED
**Created:** 2025-11-15
**Status:** CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED
**Output:** C:\Users\figon\zeebot\kickback\creative\print\KK6_EVENT_FLYER.png

## CRITICAL FIXES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION:

### FIX #1: KannaKlaus Graphic
**PROBLEM:** Previous version was "wild" - too busy/overwhelming
**SOLUTION:**
- Keep graphic SIMPLE and SMALL
- Clean, friendly Santa character with subtle cannabis elements
- Should NOT dominate the flyer
- Place it tastefully in header, not as main focal point

### FIX #2: "How to Participate" Section
**PROBLEM:** Section was "messed up" - steps not all visible
**SOLUTION:**
- MUST show ALL 3 steps clearly:
  1. Drop toy Nov 15-Dec 15
  2. Get goodies at kickback
  3. Celebrate Dec 6!
- Each step on its own line
- Numbered clearly
- Adequate spacing between steps
- Easy to read font size
