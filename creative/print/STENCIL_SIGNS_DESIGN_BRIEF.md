# KK6 STENCIL STREET SIGNS - DESIGN BRIEF

**Created:** 2025-11-26
**Method:** DIY spray paint stencils on corrugated plastic
**Target Area:** Apache Junction and surrounding East Valley

---

## SIGN SIZE ANALYSIS

**Your Material:** 10 sheets of 4'x3' (48"x36") corrugated plastic

| Size Option | Signs per Sheet | Total Signs (10 sheets) | Visibility | Best For |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------|------------|----------|
| **24"x18"** | 4 | **40 signs** | Excellent (35mph roads) | Main intersections, busy roads |
| **18"x12"** | 8 | **80 signs** | Good (25mph roads) | Neighborhoods, side streets |
| **12"x12"** | 12 | **120 signs** | Moderate (walking/slow traffic) | Dense placement, sidewalks |

### RECOMMENDATION: **18"x12"** (80 signs)
- Doubles your sign count vs 24"x18"
- Still readable from cars at 25-30mph (most AJ residential areas)
- Better for saturation coverage in target neighborhoods
- Each 1" of letter height = 10 feet readability
- 3" letters = readable from 30 feet (plenty for local roads)

**Alternative:** Mix of sizes
- 20 signs at 24"x18" for high-traffic intersections
- 40 signs at 18"x12" for neighborhood saturation

## COLOR SCHEME

**Base:** White corrugated plastic

**Spray Paint Colors:**
| Color | Use For | Hex Reference |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Christmas Red** | Headlines, "21+", key info | #C41E3A |
| **Holiday Green** | Secondary text, "420 FRIENDLY" | #228B22 |
| **Black** | Details, location, time | #000000 |

**Contrast Priority:**
1. Red on White = Highest visibility
2. Black on White = High readability
3. Green on White = Good, festive

**Avoid:** Light colors (yellow, light blue) - poor contrast

## STENCIL CUTTING GUIDE

### Tools Needed:
- X-Acto knife or box cutter
- Cutting mat or cardboard
- Ruler/straight edge
- Painter's tape (for letter bridges)
- Spray paint (2-3 cans each color)

### Letter Bridge Technique:
For enclosed letters (A, B, D, O, P, Q, R), add small bridges:
```
Standard O:  ◯     Stencil O:  ⊝ (with bridges)
Standard A:  △     Stencil A:  ⋀ (open top or bridged)
```

### Multi-Color Process:
1. Cut stencil for Color 1 (e.g., "21+ XMAS PARTY" in red)
2. Spray Color 1, let dry 10 min
3. Mask Color 1 area with paper
4. Cut/align stencil for Color 2
5. Spray Color 2
6. Repeat for Color 3

**Pro Tip:** Create ONE master stencil per line, reuse for all signs

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Timeline:
| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Nov 27-28** | Cut stencils, test spray technique |
| **Nov 29** | Production day - spray all signs |
| **Nov 30-Dec 1** | Deploy signs across AJ/Queen Creek |
| **Dec 2-5** | Signs up, driving awareness |
| **Dec 6** | EVENT DAY |
| **Dec 7-8** | Collect signs (or leave as "toy drive continues") |

### Placement Priority (Apache Junction):
1. **Main Street / Apache Trail (US-60)** - High traffic
2. **Ironwood Dr** - Near Amrahlynn's box location
3. **Superstition Blvd** - Major connector
4. **Southern Ave** - Residential traffic
5. **Intersection corners** - Stop sign visibility

### Placement Rules:
- NOT in road right-of-way (technically)
- Best: Private property with permission, or "guerrilla" placement
- Avoid blocking sidewalks or sight lines
- Stakes or lean against fences/poles

### Signs Needed per Area:
| Area | Signs | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| Apache Junction | 30-40 | HIGH |
| Gold Canyon | 10-15 | HIGH (near venue) |
| Queen Creek | 15-20 | MEDIUM |
| Santan Valley | 10-15 | MEDIUM |
