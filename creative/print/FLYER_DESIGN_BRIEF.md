- **Accent:** Festive gold (#FFD700), cannabis green (#4CAF50)
- **Background:** Deep red OR cream/off-white (NOT pure white)
- **Text:** High contrast (white on dark, black on light)

### Typography:
- **Headers:** Bold, festive fonts (think holiday poster energy)
- **Body:** Clean, readable sans-serif
- **Emphasis:** "KANNA KICKBACK 6" should be HUGE and unmissable

### Layout Style:
- Eye-catching, scrollstopping design
- NOT too cluttered (needs to be readable from 6 feet away)
- Festival/party poster vibe (fun, not corporate)
- Cannabis-friendly but NOT stereotypical stoner design
- Should work in color AND black/white (for photocopying)
