# KK6 Event Flyer - Final Regeneration Summary
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Time:** 6:18 PM
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Graphics Simplified ✅
**Problem:** KannaKlaus character and decorations were too wild and overwhelming
**Solution:**
- Reduced KannaKlaus to minimal icon (simple Santa hat with tiny leaf)
- Increased white space to 35-40%
- Removed busy decorative elements
- Clean, professional, minimal aesthetic

**Result:** The flyer now has a clean, minimal Santa hat icon at the top - barely there, not overwhelming.

### 2. "How to Participate" Section Corrected ✅
**Problem:** Text was incorrect and steps were unclear
**Solution:** Fixed all 3 steps with correct text:

**BEFORE (INCORRECT):**
1. Drop a toy Nov 15-Dec 15
2. Get goodies at kickback
3. Celebrate Dec 6!

**AFTER (CORRECT):**
1. Drop a new, unwrapped toy (Nov 15-Dec 15)
2. Get goodies & freebies at the kickback
3. Celebrate at the party (Dec 6, 2-6pm)

**Result:** All participation steps now have complete, accurate information.
