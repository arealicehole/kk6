## NOTES

This is the CORRECTED version after the first flyer had wrong toy drive amounts ($15,000 goal was completely incorrect - should be $7,000+) and potential spelling issues. All amounts and spelling have been triple-checked against source documents.

**Previous Error:**
- Said goal was $15,000 - WRONG
- Possibly had "Can of Crew" instead of "Kanna Krew"

**Corrected:**
- Goal is to BEAT $7,000 (based on $6,500 from KK5)
- All "Kanna" words verified correct spelling
- "HAPPENING" spelling verified
- All dates, locations, times verified

---

**APPROVAL AUTHORITY:** Must match this spec exactly. No creative liberties with amounts or spelling.
