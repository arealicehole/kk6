## WHAT HAPPENED

Your Black Friday post (POST #6, Nov 29) has been completely revised with a new strategic concept.

### Original Concept (Scrapped):
"Green Friday vs Black Friday" - comparison meme positioning KK6 as alternative to Black Friday shopping culture

### New Concept (Approved):
"Use Black Friday Deals to Buy Quality Gifts for Teens" - educational content teaching shoppers about teen donation needs

---

## WHY WE CHANGED IT

### The Critical Insight:
**Sojourner Center serves TEENAGERS (ages 13-17), not just little kids.**

Most people don't know this. When they think "toy drive," they think toddlers and stuffed animals.

Teens need:
- Headphones
- Gift cards
- Makeup
- Sports equipment
- Tech accessories
- Clothing
- Gaming gear
- Art supplies
- Backpacks

The stuff people are ALREADY shopping for on Black Friday.

### Why Original Concept Failed:
1. **Anti-shopping messaging** - Positioned against consumerism during biggest shopping day
2. **Missed opportunity** - Black Friday deals = chance to donate BETTER gifts
3. **Alienating tone** - "Skip shopping" pushes away mainstream audience
4. **Wrong focus** - Cannabis community niche vs broad shopper appeal

### Why New Concept Works:
1. **Educational** - Teaches what people don't know (teens need donations too)
2. **Empowering** - "Use those deals for good" vs "Skip shopping"
3. **Practical** - Specific shopping list of teen items
4. **Timely** - Black Friday to event = one week (perfect window)
5. **Inclusive** - Welcomes ALL shoppers as part of solution

## MESSAGING TRANSFORMATION

### OLD MESSAGING (Scrapped):

- Counter-culture, anti-consumerism tone

### NEW MESSAGING (Approved):
- "Black Friday shoppers – this one's for you"

## WHY THIS MATTERS

This isn't just a post revision. It's a strategic pivot that:

1. **Teaches** people something they don't know (Sojourner serves teens)
2. **Empowers** shoppers to make bigger impact with Black Friday deals
3. **Expands** reach beyond cannabis community to mainstream audience
4. **Provides** practical, actionable guidance (not just inspiration)
5. **Celebrates** smart shopping for a cause (not guilt-tripping)

Most importantly: **It actually helps teens get better gifts.**

When people learn teens need donations too, and they have a specific shopping list, and Black Friday deals make it affordable to donate quality items... that's when real impact happens.
