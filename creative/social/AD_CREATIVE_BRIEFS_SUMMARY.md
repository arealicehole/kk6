## A/B TESTING STRATEGY

### Hypothesis

**Version A (Charity-Forward):**
- Attracts mission-driven, socially conscious audiences
- Lower volume but higher quality RSVPs
- Better charity engagement (more toys per attendee)
- Skews older (30-55 age range)

**Version B (Party-Forward):**
- Attracts social, entertainment-motivated audiences
- Higher volume of total RSVPs
- Broader appeal, lower CPC
- Skews younger (21-45 age range)

### Recommended Test Approach

**Phase 1 (Nov 26-29): Equal Split**
- Run both video versions at $2.50/day each ($5/day total)
- Monitor CTR, CPC, engagement quality
- Identify early winner

**Phase 2 (Nov 30-Dec 3): Weighted to Winner**
- Allocate 70% budget to better performer
- Keep 30% on secondary version (some audiences may differ)

**Phase 3 (Dec 4-6): Final Push**
- All budget to proven winner
- Maximum urgency messaging

**Alternative: Video vs Carousel Test**
- Run one video version vs one carousel version
- Test format effectiveness (passive video vs interactive carousel)
