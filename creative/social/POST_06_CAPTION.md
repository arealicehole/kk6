## INSTAGRAM CAPTION

Black Friday shoppers – this one's for you 🛍️💚

Here's something most people don't know: **The Sojourner Center serves TEENAGERS** (ages 13-17), not just little kids.

And you know what teens don't want? More stuffed animals.

You know what they DO want? The stuff YOU'RE shopping for on Black Friday.

🎧 **Headphones**
🎮 **Gaming accessories**
💄 **Makeup & beauty products**
🎨 **Art supplies**
⚽ **Sports equipment**
👟 **Sneakers & athletic wear**
🎁 **Gift cards** (Target, Amazon, Walmart, Sephora)
📱 **Phone cases & tech accessories**
🎒 **Backpacks & school gear**
🧥 **Hoodies & clothing**

These kids are rebuilding their lives with their families after leaving domestic violence situations. They deserve gifts they'll actually love.

**So here's the move:** Use those Black Friday deals to level up your donation game. Get them something GOOD. Something they'll actually be excited about.

You've got a whole week to shop smart – KannaKickback 6 is **December 6** (next Saturday). Bring your haul to the event or drop at any of our donation box locations.

**When you shop smart, they win. And you still get a gift bag full of goodies for showing up.** 🎁

📍 Dec 6, 2-6pm, Ginza Restaurant (Gold Canyon)
🎁 Bring an age-appropriate toy, get a gift bag
🌿 Party with KannaKlaus, play Bong Pong, eat good food, support families who need it

**Drop locations:** kannakickback.com (15+ spots across Phoenix metro)

Let's use Black Friday for GOOD this year. 💚
