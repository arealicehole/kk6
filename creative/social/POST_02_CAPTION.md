We just sent the official KannaKickback 6 invite to 1,413 people. That's right—over a thousand emails went out this morning with everything you need to know about Dec 6.

Here's the deal: KannaKickback is our 6th annual holiday party and toy drive for the Sojourner Center. Bring a new, unwrapped toy to Ginza Restaurant (Gold Canyon) on December 6 from 2-6pm, and you'll get a gift bag, games, food, giveaways, and the best vibes to kick off the holiday season.

**Didn't get the email?** Check your spam folder or head straight to kannakickback.com/rsvp and lock in your spot.

**Already got it?** Forward it to someone who needs this energy. The more people who show up, the more toys we deliver to families who need them most.

6 years running. $20k+ in toys donated. All K's, no C's. Let's make KK6 the biggest one yet 💚

See you December 6. Bring a toy. Bring your crew. Let's do some good.

📍 Ginza Restaurant, Gold Canyon
