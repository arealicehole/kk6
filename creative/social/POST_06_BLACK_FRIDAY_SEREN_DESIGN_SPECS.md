## GENERATION NOTES

**For Visual-Creator Subagent:**

This is a 5-slide carousel combining two themes:
1. Educational content about teen gift gap
2. Validation from Sojourner Center interview

**Key Requirements:**
- Slide 3 (gift grid) must be highly saveable/shareable
- Seren's quotes must be accurately attributed
- Sojourner Center logo should be tastefully included (not dominating)
- Professional design that works for both cannabis community AND general public
- Balance between fun/festive and serious/impactful

**Tone:**
- Empowering (not guilt-tripping)
- Educational (filling knowledge gap)
- Celebratory (proud of track record)
- Actionable (clear next steps)

**Avoid:**
- Don't make it too "weed-heavy" - this should be shareable beyond cannabis community
- Don't overshadow Sojourner's mission with KannaKrew branding
- Don't make trauma/domestic violence the focus - keep it hope-focused
- Don't use overly emotional imagery - keep it uplifting
