## INSTAGRAM CAPTION

POV: Delivering 15+ toy boxes across the Valley 📦🚗

Every location is a chance for someone to give.

This is what it looks like behind the scenes—loading the van, driving across the metro, setting up boxes at dispensaries, smoke shops, restaurants, and local spots that said yes to hosting for us. Not glamorous, but necessary.

Every box we place is another opportunity for someone to donate. Every donation is another gift for a kid whose family is rebuilding after leaving domestic violence. That's what the Sojourner Center does—they help families start over. And KannaKrew shows up every December to support them.

This year, we've got boxes at:
📍 Ginza Restaurant (Gold Canyon)
📍 Fancy Pets (Tempe)
📍 Amrahlynn's Collectibles (Apache Junction)
📍 Level Up Smoke Shop (Glendale)
...and more coming Dec 1 👀

Shoutout to every business that said "Yeah, we'll host a box for you." You're the real MVPs. This doesn't happen without you.

If you see one of these boxes when you're out, drop a toy. If you want to HOST a box at your business, DM us. We've got extras and we'll deliver it to you.

6 years of this. Still feels good every time 💚

See you Dec 6 at KannaKickback. Bring a toy. Bring your friends. Let's make this the biggest year yet.
