## VISUAL-CREATOR AGENT PIPELINE USED

This regeneration utilized the visual-creator autonomous agent system:

1. **Content Parser** - Extracted design specifications from POST_01_DESIGN_SPECS.md
2. **Prompt Engineer** - Created optimized prompts for Nano Banana model
3. **Generator** - Called OpenRouter API with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
4. **Reviewer** - Quality control verification (all passed)
5. **Coordinator** - Orchestrated full workflow and saved final outputs

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- ✅ All 5 slides generated successfully
- ✅ All slides are valid PNG images (1024x1024)
- ✅ Correct day: "Saturday, December 6th" on Slides 1 and 5
- ✅ Consistent branding across all slides
- ✅ File sizes appropriate for Instagram upload
- ✅ No API errors or quality issues
- ✅ Temporary files cleaned up

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review slides** visually to ensure text is readable and designs match specs
2. **Upload to Instagram** as a 5-slide carousel
3. **Update POST_01_DESIGN_SPECS.md** to correct the inconsistency (line 333 still shows "Friday")
4. **Pin to profile** immediately after posting

---

## NOTES

- The design specification document (POST_01_DESIGN_SPECS.md) has an inconsistency:
  - Line 72 correctly shows "Saturday, December 6th"
  - Line 333 (Slide 5 spec) incorrectly shows "Friday, December 6, 2025"
- This regeneration used the CORRECT day (Saturday) for all slides
- Consider updating the spec document to fix line 333
