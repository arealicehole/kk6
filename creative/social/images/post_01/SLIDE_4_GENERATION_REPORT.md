## COMPARISON TO ORIGINAL DESIGN SPECS

The original design specs (POST_01_DESIGN_SPECS.md) suggested:
- Vertical process flow with numbered steps ✅
- Icons for each step ✅ (emojis used instead)
- Arrows connecting steps ❌ (omitted for cleaner look)
- Cannabis leaf snowflakes as decoration ❌ (simplified for readability)

**Decision:** The generated image is BETTER than the original specs because it prioritized the user's critical requirement for a "CLEAN and SIMPLE" layout over decorative elements. The result is more readable and professional.
