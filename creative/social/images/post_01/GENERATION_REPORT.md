## QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Scoring Breakdown
All slides received a quality score of **0.75/1.0**, which met the acceptance threshold for second-attempt generation (0.70).

**Quality Thresholds Used:**
- Attempt 1: 0.80 (strict)
- Attempt 2: 0.70 (lenient)
- Attempt 3: 0.60 (accept if reasonable)

**Note:** All slides were accepted on the second attempt. The V0 quality reviewer uses basic image validation (size, format) rather than sophisticated OCR text verification. Manual human review is recommended to verify:
- Text spelling accuracy
- Brand color compliance
- Visual composition quality
- KannaKlaus character consistency

---

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Pipeline Workflow
1. **Content Parser:** Extracted design specifications from `POST_01_DESIGN_SPECS.md`
2. **Prompt Engineer:** Used pre-written AI prompts from design specs (optimized for Nano Banana)
3. **Generator:** Called OpenRouter API with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
4. **Reviewer:** V0 simple quality check (file validation only)
5. **Decision:** Accept/retry based on attempt number and quality score

### API Configuration
- **Endpoint:** https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
- **Model:** google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview
- **API Key:** sk-or-v1-3e28...97fb (redacted)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square format)
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1080px
- **Format:** PNG
- **Rate Limits:** 20 requests/minute, 1000 requests/day (with credits)

### Generation Parameters
- **Max Retries:** 3 attempts per slide
- **Retry Logic:** Quality score must meet threshold for attempt number
- **Timeout:** 120 seconds per API call
- **Error Handling:** Exponential backoff on rate limits, no retry on auth errors

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Manual Review:** Examine all 5 images for text accuracy, brand compliance, and visual quality
2. **Text Verification:** Check that all text matches design specs exactly (OCR or visual inspection)
3. **Brand Check:** Verify colors match brand palette (Forest Green #2D5016, Holiday Red #C41E3A, Gold #FFD700)
4. **Character Consistency:** Ensure KannaKlaus character is consistent across slides where featured

### If Regeneration Needed
- Individual slides can be regenerated by modifying prompts and re-running script
- Increase quality threshold if higher standards required
- Add negative prompts to avoid specific issues

### Posting to Instagram
Once approved:
1. Upload all 5 slides to Instagram as carousel
2. Use caption from `POST_01_INSTAGRAM_ANCHOR.md`
3. Pin post to profile
4. Share to Stories
5. Cross-post to Facebook/Twitter

## AGENT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

### Coordinator Agent
- Successfully orchestrated full pipeline
- Managed 5-slide generation workflow
- Handled quality thresholds and retry logic

### Content Parser Agent
- Extracted all slide specifications from markdown
- Identified pre-written AI prompts in design specs
- No modifications needed to original prompts

### Prompt Engineer Agent
- Used pre-written prompts from POST_01_DESIGN_SPECS.md
- Prompts were already optimized for Nano Banana model
- No additional prompt engineering required

### Generator Agent
- Successfully called OpenRouter API 10 times (2 attempts per slide)
- Handled image extraction from nested JSON response
- No API errors or rate limiting encountered

### Reviewer Agent
- V0 implementation: Basic file validation only
- All images passed size/format checks
- Flagged all for manual human review (0.75 score indicates manual verification needed)

## ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

### Resolved Issues
1. **Unicode Encoding Error:** Fixed by reconfiguring stdout encoding for Windows console
2. **Image Data Extraction:** Corrected nested JSON path (`images[0]['image_url']['url']`)
3. **Quality Threshold:** All slides missed 0.80 first-attempt threshold but passed 0.70 second-attempt threshold

### Known Limitations (V0)
1. **No OCR Text Verification:** Cannot automatically verify text spelling accuracy
2. **No Brand Color Analysis:** Cannot programmatically check color palette compliance
3. **No Character Consistency Check:** Cannot verify KannaKlaus character across slides
4. **Manual Review Required:** Human must verify all quality aspects

### Recommendations for V0.2
1. Add pytesseract OCR for text extraction and verification
2. Implement color palette analysis using PIL
3. Add image similarity scoring for character consistency
4. Increase quality thresholds or improve prompts to reduce regeneration attempts
