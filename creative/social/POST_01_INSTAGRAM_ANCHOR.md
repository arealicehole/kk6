• VIBES

🎁 HOW IT WORKS:
**TOY DRIVE: Nov 15 - Dec 15**
Donation boxes at dispensaries, smoke shops, and community spots across the Valley. Bring a new, unwrapped toy and get goodies & freebies at the kickback.

**THE PARTY: Dec 6, 2-6pm**
Pull up to the Kickback to celebrate with food, games, vendors, and community love.

**DELIVERY: Dec 15**
All toys delivered to Sojourner Center to help local families this holiday season.
