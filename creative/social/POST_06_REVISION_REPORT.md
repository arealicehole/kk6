# POST #6 - CRITICAL REVISION REPORT
**Date Revised:** November 21, 2025
**Original Concept Date:** November 20, 2025
**Post Date:** November 29, 2025 (Black Friday)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All files revised and approved

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

POST #6 has been completely revised with a new strategic direction that transforms the messaging from "anti-shopping" to "smart shopping for teens in need."

**Original concept:** "Green Friday vs Black Friday" comparison meme positioning KK6 as alternative to Black Friday shopping (rejected)

**New concept:** Educational content teaching Black Friday shoppers to use sales to buy quality, age-appropriate gifts for teenagers (ages 13-17) at Sojourner Center (approved)

---

## WHY THIS REVISION WAS CRITICAL

### Key Discovery:
**Sojourner Center serves teens up to 17 years old** - not just little kids. Most people don't know this.

### The Problem with Original Concept:
1. **Anti-shopping messaging** - Positioned against consumerism during biggest shopping day
2. **Missed opportunity** - Black Friday deals = chance to donate BETTER gifts
3. **Wrong audience** - Alienated shoppers instead of empowering them
4. **Little kid focus** - Didn't highlight teen needs (13-17 years old)
5. **Preachy tone** - "Skip shopping" is guilt-trippy and unrealistic

### Why New Concept Works Better:
1. **Educational** - Teaches what most people don't know (teens need donations too)
2. **Empowering** - "Use those deals for good" vs "Skip shopping"
3. **Practical** - Specific shopping list of teen-appropriate items
4. **Timely** - Meets people where they are (shopping on Black Friday)
5. **Actionable** - Clear next steps with one week to shop and donate
6. **Positive** - Celebrates smart shopping when it's for a cause

## MESSAGING TRANSFORMATION

### Original Messaging (SCRAPPED):
- ❌ "Black Friday? We don't know her"
- ❌ "Skip the lines, bring a toy to KK6"
- ❌ "Green Friday = Give back 100% and feel good about it"
- ❌ "Choose wisely" (implies shopping is wrong choice)
- ❌ Focus: Cannabis community as alternative to mainstream shopping
- ❌ Tone: Counter-culture, anti-consumerism, elitist

### New Messaging (APPROVED):
- ✅ "Black Friday shoppers - this one's for you"
- ✅ "They have TEENAGERS (ages 13-17)"
- ✅ "Use those Black Friday deals to donate something they'll actually love"
- ✅ "Shop smart, give better"
- ✅ Focus: Teen needs + practical gift ideas + smart use of sales
- ✅ Tone: Educational, empowering, inclusive, practical

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What We Discovered:
1. **Teen services are under-recognized** - Most people don't know domestic violence shelters serve teens
2. **Black Friday is opportunity, not enemy** - Sales enable better donations
3. **Education beats preaching** - Teaching > judging = better engagement
4. **Inclusivity expands reach** - Welcoming all shoppers > appealing to niche only
5. **Practical beats ideological** - "Here's how to help" > "You should do this"

### How This Applies to Future KK6 Content:
- Lead with educational value when challenging assumptions
- Embrace mainstream moments (holidays, shopping events) as opportunities
- Provide specific, actionable guidance (not just inspiration)
- Welcome all audiences (don't gatekeep with counter-culture messaging)
- Celebrate smart choices instead of shaming mainstream ones
