# SOJOURNER CENTER INTERVIEW - MULTI-PLATFORM CONTENT STRATEGY

**Created:** 2025-11-21
**Event Date:** December 6, 2025 (15 days away)
**Interview Subject:** Seren (Community Engagement Manager, Sojourner Center)
**Video Files:** 6 clips, 3.6GB total

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Golden Nuggets:
1. **VALIDATION BOMB:** "You've outdone corporations" - KannaKrew is Sojourner's largest individual donor
2. **TEEN GAP INSIGHT:** Teens (13-17) are forgotten in toy drives - they need age-appropriate gifts
3. **TRACK RECORD:** $4,200 → $5,500 → $6,500 growth trajectory (beat this year!)
4. **EMOTIONAL HOOK:** "Someone in the Krew was helped by them" - personal connection
5. **AUTONOMY ANGLE:** "Gifting Hope store" lets families choose their own gifts (dignity-focused)

### Strategic Priority:
**CREATE 3-4 PIECES OF CONTENT IMMEDIATELY** - Event is 15 days away, content needs to work NOW to drive donations and attendance.

## 📊 CONTENT ANALYSIS

### Video Clip Breakdown:

**CLIP 1 (PXL_20251121_183132720.mp4 - 777MB):**
- **Duration:** ~9-10 minutes (estimated)
- **Content:** Seren introduces herself and Sojourner Center
- **Key Quote:** "I'm the community engagement manager here at Sojourner Center. That means I run the donation resource center as well as work with all the volunteers."
- **Key Quote:** "We do serve families here, and that actually means we're very fortunate because we have a lot more space than some shelters, so we're able to hold large families."
- **Key Quote:** "We have three programs. We have a crisis shelter, a transitional shelter, as well as a community outreach, which is exactly what it sounds like, getting out there and helping all over Maricopa."
- **Usage:** **EXCELLENT** for "What is Sojourner?" educational content

**CLIP 2 (PXL_20251121_183321828.mp4 - 812MB):**
- **Duration:** ~9-10 minutes (estimated)
- **Content:** Gifting Hope campaign details + donation guidelines
- **Key Quote:** "We do operate through a store we call Gifting Hope, which ends up being an entire campaign to help us fill that store with toys. This is going to last, starting now until December 24th."
- **Key Quote:** "We'll be allowing folks to shop for their kids with autonomy in the store, which is really cool. So they come in and they get to choose what they want for their kids."
- **🔥 CRITICAL QUOTE:** "We need variety. We let people shop and choose what they need. So if you're thinking infant, we also need infant to 17 years old. So think about those kids. Maybe the ones we won't remember. We don't know what they might like, you might know."
- **Key Quote:** "Remember, no guns, no knives, anything violent. Mostly because of the nature of our work."

- **Key Quote:** "I think last year we reached 6,500. If I remember correctly, that means you've outdone yourself every year and you've actually beat other corporations around here."
- **Key Quote:** "And we at Sojourner just want to say thank you... Cana Crew has really showed up every year. Each year you bring more money."

**CLIP 4 (PXL_20251121_183803103.mp4 - 274MB):**
- **Duration:** ~3-4 minutes (short)
- **Content:** Repeat/retake of validation message

"Think about the ones we won't remember. We don't know what they might like, you might know." - Seren, Community Engagement Manager

🎧 Headphones
🎮 Gaming gift cards
💄 Makeup/skincare
🎨 Art supplies
👟 Sports gear
📱 Phone accessories
🎒 Backpacks
📚 Books/journals

THIS is how you make an impact for teens who rarely get thought of.

**Impact:** Deep storytelling, trust-building, email-shareable

**Format:** Long-form text post with photo carousel

**Post Copy:**
```
Why do we throw the same party every December?

Because in 2020, someone in the Krew needed help. Sojourner Center was there.

Now it's our turn to show up. Every. Single. Year.

---

Yesterday, we sat down with Seren, the Community Engagement Manager at Sojourner Center, and she told us something we'll never forget:

"Cana Crew has really showed up every year. You've outdone yourself, and you've actually outdone other programs that donate to us — and we have some large corporations coming in."

We're not a corporation. We're not a massive organization. We're just a group of friends who smoke together, throw parties together, and believe in taking care of our community.

But apparently, we're Sojourner Center's LARGEST INDIVIDUAL DONOR.

Let that sink in.

---

Here's our track record:
• KannaKickback 3 (2022): $4,200 in toys
• KannaKickback 4 (2023): $5,500 in toys
• KannaKickback 5 (2024): $6,500 in toys

Every year, we've outdone ourselves. And this year? We're going for $7,000+.

But here's what makes this even more important:

Sojourner Center doesn't just serve domestic violence survivors — they serve FAMILIES. Including teenagers (ages 13-17).

Seren told us: "Think about the kids we won't remember. We don't know what they might like, but you might know."

Most toy drives forget about teens. They get the leftover stuffed animals, the baby toys no one else wanted. But they're in those shelters too. They need gifts too. They deserve to feel seen too.

So this year, we're asking you to think about them:
🎧 Headphones
🎮 Gaming gift cards
💄 Makeup/skincare
🎨 Art supplies
👟 Sports gear
📱 Phone accessories
🎒 Backpacks
📚 Books/journals

---

🎁 HOW TO HELP:

1️⃣ Drop a new, unwrapped toy at any of our 15+ donation boxes across the Valley (link in comments)

2️⃣ Come to KannaKickback 6 on December 6th (2-6pm @ Ginza Gold Canyon) and bring a gift

3️⃣ Share this post with someone who wants to make a difference

---

We're not doing this for clout. We're not doing this for recognition. We're doing this because someone we love was helped by Sojourner Center, and we'll never forget that.

Let's beat $6,500. Let's show up for these families. Let's make sure every kid — especially the teens — gets something they'll actually love.

💚 KannaKrew | KannaKickback | KannaKlaus
All K's. No C's. Always community.

[Header Image: Seren from Sojourner Center]

Hey [First Name],

Yesterday, we sat down with Seren from Sojourner Center, and she told us something that hit different:

"Cana Crew has really showed up every year. You've outdone yourself, and you've actually outdone other programs that donate to us — and we have some large corporations coming in."

We're not a corporation. We're just a group of friends who smoke together, throw parties together, and believe in showing up for our community.

But apparently, we're Sojourner Center's LARGEST INDIVIDUAL DONOR.

[Graphic: $4,200 → $5,500 → $6,500 → ???]

Here's why this matters:

🏠 Sojourner Center is a domestic violence shelter serving families across Maricopa County
🎁 They run "Gifting Hope" - a store where survivors CHOOSE their kids' gifts (dignity-focused)
👥 They serve FAMILIES, including teenagers (13-17) who get forgotten in toy drives
💚 Someone in the Krew was helped by them. Now it's our turn to show up. Every year.

HERE'S THE THING ABOUT TEENS:

Most toy drives forget about them. They get leftover stuffed animals and baby toys.

But Seren told us: "Think about the kids we won't remember. We don't know what they might like, but you might know."

So if you're donating this year, think about teens:
🎧 Headphones
🎮 Gaming gift cards
💄 Makeup/skincare
🎨 Art supplies
👟 Sports gear
📱 Phone accessories

### 3. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:

**Instagram (Primary Platform):**
- ✅ Short-form video (Reel)
- ✅ Carousel (4 slides)
- ✅ Story series (5-7 parts)
- ⚠️ IGTV (if YouTube video created)
- **Why prioritize:** Largest audience, best engagement, visual-first platform

**TikTok:**
- ✅ Short-form video (60-90s)
- ✅ Story series (convert to video slideshow)
- ❌ Carousel (not supported)
- **Why prioritize:** Algorithmic reach, younger audience, teen gift message resonates here

**Facebook:**
- ✅ Short-form video (share from IG)
- ✅ Carousel (share from IG)
- ✅ Long-form post (native to FB)
- ✅ Event page shares (all content)
- **Why prioritize:** Older audience, longer attention span, shareability for family/friends

**YouTube:**
- ⚠️ Long-form video (5-7 min)
- ⚪ Shorts (60s version)
- **Why deprioritize:** More effort, smaller KannaKrew audience, but evergreen SEO value

**Email:**
- ✅ Newsletter feature (text + video embeds)
- **Why prioritize:** Warm audience (1,223 subscribers), direct communication, drive RSVPs

**Website:**
- ⚪ Blog post (evergreen, SEO)
- ✅ Embed video content
- **Why deprioritize:** Lower traffic, but good for link sharing and evergreen reference

### 4. MAXIMIZE "BEATING CORPORATIONS" VALIDATION ANGLE:

**Why This Matters:**
- 🏆 Social proof: "If Sojourner trusts them, we can too"
- 💪 Community power: "We're not a big brand, but we show up"
- 🎯 Differentiation: "This isn't corporate charity, this is grassroots"
- 🔥 Shareability: "Underdogs beat corporations" is a viral narrative

**How to Maximize:**

1. **Lead with it in all content:**
   - "You've outdone corporations" quote in first 5 seconds of video
   - "Largest individual donor" in carousel slide 1
   - "Beat corporations" in email subject line

2. **Visual emphasis:**
   - Text overlay: "BEAT CORPORATIONS" in bold
   - Graphic comparison: "KannaKrew $6,500 > [Corporation Logo] $X,XXX"
   - Trophy emoji 🏆 or medal graphic

3. **Repeat the numbers:**
   - $4,200 → $5,500 → $6,500 (growth trajectory)
   - "4th year in a row" (consistency)
   - "Goal: $7,000+" (aspirational)

4. **Community angle:**
   - "We're not a corporation. We're just friends who smoke together."
   - "Community over everything"
   - "Grassroots charity beats big business"

5. **Call-to-action tie-in:**
   - "Help us keep the title"
   - "Let's beat $6,500 together"
   - "Show corporations how it's done"

---

### 5. EMPHASIZE TEEN GIFT GAP EFFECTIVELY:

**Why This Matters:**
- 🎯 Fills a real need: Most people don't know teens are in shelters
- 💡 Actionable advice: People want to help but don't know how
- 🎁 Differentiation: "We're not just asking for toys, we're asking for the RIGHT toys"
- 📚 Educational: Teach people something they didn't know

**How to Emphasize:**

1. **Lead with the problem:**
   - "Here's what most people don't know about toy drives..."
   - "TEENS (13-17) are forgotten in toy drives"
   - "They get leftover teddy bears. They need headphones."

2. **Use Seren's quote:**
   - "Think about the ones we won't remember" is POWERFUL
   - Overlay on visuals, use in captions, quote in emails

3. **Visual contrast:**
   - Side-by-side: "What they get ❌" (baby toys) vs "What they need ✅" (teen gifts)
   - Before/After aesthetic

4. **Provide specific gift ideas:**
   - Don't just say "age-appropriate" - LIST EXAMPLES
   - 🎧 Headphones, 🎮 Gaming gift cards, 💄 Makeup, 🎨 Art supplies
   - Make it EASY for people to know what to buy

5. **Emotional appeal:**
   - "Teens in shelters deserve to feel seen too"
   - "Imagine being 16 and getting a teddy bear"
   - "They're going through the same trauma, but they're invisible"

6. **Call-to-action:**
   - "Donate something a teen will actually love"
   - "Think about what YOU wanted at 15"
   - "Make a 13-17 year old feel special this year"

### 6. SHOULD WE CREATE LONG-FORM CONTENT FOR YOUTUBE/PODCAST?

**VERDICT: YES, BUT ONLY IF:**

✅ **Create YouTube video IF:**
- Gilbert or team has time to edit 5-7 min video by Nov 28
- OR willing to outsource editing ($50-150 for quick turnaround)
- **ROI:** Evergreen content, SEO value, deep trust-building

⚠️ **Create podcast episode IF:**
- Already planning to record episode this week anyway
- OR can batch-record with Hot Box Podcast setup (minimal extra effort)
- **ROI:** Existing audience engagement, intimate storytelling

❌ **Skip long-form content IF:**
- Short on time (event is 15 days away)
- No existing audience for YouTube/podcast
- Short-form content is priority (IG, TikTok, FB)

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- ✅ **YES to YouTube video** - Evergreen value, can repurpose post-event
- ⚠️ **MAYBE to podcast** - Only if easy to execute
- ✅ **DEFINITELY prioritize short-form first** - Highest ROI for time invested
