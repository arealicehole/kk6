          "content": "\"You've outdone corporations\" 🙌\n\nWhen Seren from @sojournercenters told us KannaKrew is their largest INDIVIDUAL donor... we had to sit with that for a second.\n\nWe're not a big brand. We're not a massive organization. We're just a group of friends who smoke together, throw parties together, and believe in showing up for our community.\n\nBut apparently we're doing it better than the corporations.\n\nYear 1: $4,200 in toys\nYear 2: $5,500 in toys\nYear 3: $6,500 in toys\nYear 4: ???\n\nThis started because someone in the Krew needed help. Sojourner Center was there for them. Now it's our turn to show up. Every. Single. Year.\n\n💚 3 WAYS TO HELP:\n\n1️⃣ DONATE A TOY\nDrop new, unwrapped toys at 15+ donation boxes across the Valley (ages infant-17, think about the TEENS)\n📍 Find locations: [link in bio]\n\n2️⃣ COME TO KANNA KICKBACK 6\n🎄 Dec 6, 2-6pm @ Ginza Restaurant, Gold Canyon\n🎁 Bring a toy, get goodies, celebrate community\n\n3️⃣ VOLUNTEER WITH SOJOURNER\nThey need help year-round in the Gifting Hope store, donation center, and more\n🔗 Sign up: sojournercenters.org/volunteer\n\nLet's beat $6,500. Let's show these families — especially the teens who get forgotten — that community shows up different.\n\nAll K's. No C's. Always community. 💚\n\n#KannaKickback #KannaKrew #SojournerCenter #PhoenixAZ #CommunityOverEverything #DomesticViolenceAwareness #HolidayGiving #ToyDrive #ArizonaCannabis #VolunteerPhoenix",

          "content": "\"KannaKrew has really showed up every year. You've outdone yourself, and you've actually outdone other programs that donate to us — and we have some large corporations coming in.\"\n\nWhen Seren, the Community Engagement Manager at Sojourner Center, said those words... it hit different.\n\nWe're not a corporation. We don't have boardrooms or PR teams. We're just a group of friends who smoke together, throw parties together, and believe that community means showing up for each other.\n\nBut somehow, we've become Sojourner Center's LARGEST INDIVIDUAL DONOR.\n\nHere's our track record:\n• KannaKickback 3: $4,200 in toys\n• KannaKickback 4: $5,500 in toys\n• KannaKickback 5: $6,500 in toys\n• KannaKickback 6: ???\n\nThis partnership started because someone in the Krew needed help. Sojourner Center was there for them. They provided shelter, safety, support — everything a survivor of domestic violence needs to rebuild their life.\n\nNow it's our turn to be there for them. Every. Single. Year.\n\n---\n\n💚 3 WAYS YOU CAN HELP:\n\n1️⃣ DONATE A TOY\nDrop new, unwrapped toys at 15+ donation boxes across Phoenix (infant to 17 — don't forget the TEENS!)\nFind locations: kannakickback.com\n\n2️⃣ COME TO KANNA KICKBACK 6\n🎄 Friday, December 6 | 2-6pm\n📍 Ginza Restaurant, Gold Canyon\n🎁 Bring a toy, get goodies, celebrate community\nRSVP: kannakickback.com\n\n3️⃣ VOLUNTEER WITH SOJOURNER CENTER\nThey need help year-round in the Gifting Hope store, donation resource center, and more.
