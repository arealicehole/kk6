Why do we throw the same party every December? Because in 2020, someone in the Krew needed Sojourner Center. They were there. Now we're here for them 💚

**6 years. $20k+ in toys. One mission.**

Let me break down why KannaKickback exists:

**2020 (KK1):** Started in the middle of a pandemic. $4,200 in toys donated. We didn't know if this would be a one-time thing.

**2022 (KK3):** $5,500 in toys. Officially partnered with Sojourner Center because someone close to us was helped by them. This became bigger than just a holiday party.

**2024 (KK5):** $6,500 in toys. Community tradition solidified. People started asking in October when KK6 was happening.

**2025 (KK6):** This year, we're aiming for $7,000+. Not because we need to hit a number, but because more toys = more kids get gifts = more families feel supported during the hardest time of their lives.

Sojourner Center helps families rebuild after leaving domestic violence. They provide shelter, counseling, legal help, childcare, job training—everything someone needs to start over. And every December, we make sure the kids in those families get toys.

That's it. That's why we do this.

So when you show up to KannaKickback on Dec 6, you're not just coming to a party. You're part of a 6-year tradition of showing up for people who need it most.

Bring a toy. Bring your crew. Be part of the legacy.

📍 Dec 6, 2-6pm, Ginza Restaurant (Gold Canyon)
🎁 1 toy = gift bag, games, food, giveaways
💚 All toys → Sojourner Center families
