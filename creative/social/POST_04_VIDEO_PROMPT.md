## SORA/RUNWAY VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

"Create a 25-second behind-the-scenes montage video showing toy donation box delivery across Phoenix, Arizona. Vertical format 1080x1920px.

**Opening (0-5s):** Van or SUV loaded with festive green and red donation boxes featuring KannaKlaus character design on top. Arizona outdoor setting, blue sky, parking lot, daytime natural lighting. Team members (2-3 diverse people in casual hoodies and jeans) loading final boxes. Text overlay appears: 'POV: Delivery Day 📦' in bold white font with shadow.

**Middle sequence 1 (5-10s):** Driving shots through Phoenix metro area - freeway views with desert landscape, saguaro cacti in distance, urban streets, strip malls. Quick cuts showing journey across valley. Text overlay: '15+ boxes across the Valley' in white.

**Middle sequence 2 (10-18s):** Four quick location drops (3-4 seconds each):
- Smoke shop exterior: Modern glass door with neon cannabis signage, team member carrying box inside
- Dispensary interior: Professional counter, team placing box on display
- Asian restaurant: Cozy interior, box being set up near entrance
- Collectibles shop: Unique storefront, box placement on counter
Each location shows the festive KannaKlaus box topper clearly. Text overlay: 'Every location = more impact' in white.

**Close-up sequence (18-23s):** Close shots of empty donation boxes ready for toys. KannaKlaus character design on box topper prominently featured. Boxes are clean, inviting, festive green and red colors. Text overlay: 'Ready for donations ✅' in gold.

**Ending (23-28s):** Candid team moment - 2-3 team members standing by van or in front of location, smiling naturally, giving thumbs up or peace signs. Authentic, not overly posed. Arizona sunshine, warm vibe. Text overlay: '6 years of showing up' in white, then '💚' heart emoji appears.

**Final frame (28-30s):** Text overlay on dark green background: 'Find a location near you' then 'kannakickback.com/locations' in gold. KannaKrew logo appears bottom-center.

**Music:** Upbeat instrumental hip-hop or indie folk track, moderate tempo (110-120 BPM), positive community vibe, no lyrics. Music builds slightly toward ending then softens for final CTA frame.

**Style notes:** Documentary-style authenticity, warm Arizona daylight, natural movements (not overly smooth or cinematic - should feel real and candid), cannabis-friendly aesthetic, festive holiday colors throughout, emphasis on community work and accessibility. Avoid overly polished corporate video look - aim for genuine behind-the-scenes energy."

## ALTERNATIVE: USER-GENERATED STYLE PROMPT

If aiming for more authentic iPhone footage aesthetic:

"Create a 25-second vertical video with smartphone-shot aesthetic (slight camera shake, natural lighting, authentic framing). Show toy donation box delivery journey across Phoenix. Opening: phone footage of van trunk loaded with festive boxes, person's hands adjusting boxes. Cut to: dashboard cam view driving through Phoenix streets. Cut to: walking into smoke shop/dispensary carrying box (POV style). Cut to: placing box on counter,店 staff nodding approval. Cut to: 3-4 more quick location clips. Cut to: selfie-style clip with team members smiling. Text overlays in TikTok style (bold sans-serif): 'delivery day 📦', '15+ boxes', 'every location = more impact', 'ready for donations ✅', '6 years of showing up 💚'. Ending: static frame with website. Music: Trending TikTok audio or upbeat royalty-free track. Feel: Real, unpolished, relatable, community-driven."
