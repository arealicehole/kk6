### 💚 WHY SOJOURNER CENTER?

Sojourner Center is Arizona's largest provider of services for survivors of domestic violence. They offer emergency shelter, counseling, legal advocacy, and support to thousands of families every year.

Someone in the KannaKrew was directly helped by Sojourner Center. This isn't just charity—it's personal. We give back because they were there when it mattered most.

Every toy we collect goes directly to families rebuilding their lives. Every donation makes a difference.

### 🎄 THE KANNA KICKBACK STORY

Started in 2020, KannaKickback is KannaKrew's annual tradition of throwing the most festive, cannabis-friendly holiday party in the Valley.

What began as a small kickback has grown into a community-driven movement. By KK3 (2022), we added the toy drive to give back to Sojourner Center. Every year since, we've grown—more toys, more people, more impact.

This is Year 6. Let's make it legendary.

**Fun first. Charity always.**

Pull up. Bring a toy. Celebrate community.

**📅 Saturday, December 6th • 2-6 PM • Ginza, Gold Canyon**

See you there. 💚🎄
