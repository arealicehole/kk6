## SOURCE TYPES - REAL vs AI vs GRAPHICS

**SOURCE TYPE KEY:**
- 🎬 REAL = Must be actual photos (authenticity matters)
- 🤖 AI = Can generate if no real photo available
- 🎨 GRAPHICS = Designed elements, text overlays, icons

**PRIORITY REAL PHOTOS NEEDED (Can't fake these):**
1. 🎬 Ginza food (orange chicken hero shot) - CRITICAL
2. 🎬 Ginza exterior - CRITICAL for venue trust
3. 🎬 Past KK event community shots (scrubbed of weed) - Authenticity
4. 🎬 Actual toys from past toy drives - Real impact proof
5. 🎬 KannaKlaus in costume (if available)

**CARD-BY-CARD SOURCE BREAKDOWN:**
| Card | Element | Source Type | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Toy pile | 🎬 REAL preferred / 🤖 AI backup | Use actual KK5 toy photos if available |
| 1 | Holiday backdrop | 🎬 REAL / 🎨 GRAPHICS | Combine as needed |
| 1 | Sojourner logo | 🎨 GRAPHICS | Official logo asset (small) |
| 2 | Sojourner logo | 🎨 GRAPHICS | Official logo asset (large) |
| 2 | Mother/child imagery | 🤖 AI / Licensed stock | NOT real beneficiaries |
| 3 | KannaKlaus | 🎬 REAL if costume exists / 🤖 AI character | Check past event photos |
| 3 | Holiday background | 🎬 REAL / 🎨 GRAPHICS | Can composite |
| 4 | Ginza exterior | 🎬 REAL - CRITICAL | Shoot fresh if needed |
| 4 | Orange chicken | 🎬 REAL - CRITICAL | Get from Ginza or shoot |
| 4 | Food collage | 🎬 REAL - CRITICAL | Multiple Ginza food shots |
| 5 | Community gathering | 🎬 REAL - CRITICAL | Past KK events (scrubbed of weed) |
| 5 | Gift tag concept | 🎨 GRAPHICS alternative | If no good community photo |

**CHARITY MESSAGING + REAL FOOTAGE = MAXIMUM TRUST**
For the charity-forward version, authentic imagery is extra important. People donating want to see REAL impact.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**This carousel will be successful if:**
- CTR (Click-Through Rate) > 1.2%
- CPC (Cost Per Click) < $0.55
- Swipe-through rate > 40% (users view 3+ cards)
- Engagement (likes, shares, comments) > 2% of impressions
- Positive comments mentioning charity/mission
- Lower CPC than Version B if hypothesis holds

**Hypothesis:**
Charity-forward carousel allows for deeper storytelling than video, engaging detail-oriented audiences who want to understand the impact. Sequential narrative builds trust and motivates action from mission-aligned attendees.

---

## A/B TEST COMPARISON NOTES

**Carousel vs Video (Version A):**
- **Carousel Pros:** More information, user-controlled pace, works on slow connections
- **Carousel Cons:** Requires engagement (swiping), less "snackable" than video
- **Video Pros:** Passive consumption, higher engagement, better for Stories placement
- **Video Cons:** Requires good connection, auto-plays can annoy users

**Expected Performance:**
- Carousel may have lower CTR but higher quality leads (people who engaged deeply)
- Video will likely have higher overall reach and volume
- Carousel better for retargeting (people who engaged before)

---

## OPTIMIZATION NOTES

**After 2-3 Days of Running:**

**If Card 1 has low click-through:**
- Test different impact stat ("400+ toys" vs "$6,500")
- Try action shot (toy being donated) vs static pile

**If Swipe-through rate is low (<30%):**
- Add "Swipe →" arrow graphic to Card 1
- Make Card 1 more intriguing/mysterious (tease info rather than state it)

**If Overall CTR is low:**
- Test different CTA button ("RSVP" vs "Learn More" vs "Get Tickets")
- Adjust primary text (shorter/punchier vs detailed)

---
