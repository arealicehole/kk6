## SOURCE TYPES - REAL vs AI vs GRAPHICS

**SOURCE TYPE KEY:**
- 🎬 REAL = Must be actual footage/photos (authenticity matters)
- 🤖 AI = Can generate if no real footage available
- 🎨 GRAPHICS = Motion graphics, text overlays, icons

**PRIORITY REAL FOOTAGE NEEDED (Can't fake these):**
1. 🎬 Ginza food (orange chicken hero shot) - CRITICAL
2. 🎬 Ginza exterior/interior - CRITICAL for venue trust
3. 🎬 Past KK event crowd shots (scrubbed of weed) - Authenticity
4. 🎬 KannaKlaus in costume (if available)
5. 🎬 Actual toys from past toy drives

**SCENE-BY-SCENE SOURCE BREAKDOWN:**
| Scene | Element | Source Type | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Toy pile | 🎬 REAL preferred / 🤖 AI backup | Use KK5 photos if available |
| 1 | Bokeh lights | 🎨 GRAPHICS overlay | Can add in post |
| 2 | Sojourner logo | 🎨 GRAPHICS | Official logo asset |
| 2 | Children opening presents | 🤖 AI / Stock licensed | Not from our event |
| 3 | KannaKlaus | 🎬 REAL if costume footage exists / 🤖 AI character | Check past event photos |
| 3 | Holiday decorations | 🎬 REAL / 🎨 GRAPHICS overlay | Combine as needed |
| 4 | Ginza exterior | 🎬 REAL - CRITICAL | Shoot fresh if needed |
| 4 | Food spread | 🎬 REAL - CRITICAL | Get from Ginza or shoot |
| 5 | Community montage | 🎬 REAL - CRITICAL | Past KK events (scrubbed) |
| 5 | Donation box shot | 🎬 REAL preferred | Stage if needed |
| 6 | Final CTA screen | 🎨 GRAPHICS | Design in post |

**REAL FOOTAGE AUTHENTICITY = HIGHER TRUST = BETTER CONVERSIONS**
For charity-forward messaging especially, real footage of actual impact (toys, community) builds trust.
