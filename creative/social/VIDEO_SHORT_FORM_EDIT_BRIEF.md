- Consistent look across all clips
- Slightly increase saturation for visual pop
- Green/gold color accents to match brand

**Transitions:**
- Clean cuts (minimal fancy transitions)
- Simple fades or wipes between major sections
- Match action cuts where possible

**Audio:**
- Normalize all audio levels (Seren's voice should be consistent volume)
- Remove background noise/hum if present
- Add subtle room tone or background ambience if clips feel too dead

**Captions:**
- Use auto-captioning tool (CapCut, Descript, or Premiere Pro auto-transcribe)
- Proofread for accuracy (fix "Cana" → "Kanna", etc.)
- 2-3 words per caption card max (easy to read quickly)

## CAPTION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA

WE BEAT CORPORATIONS 🏆

For real. Seren from @sojourner_center just told us we're their LARGEST individual donor. Even bigger than corporations.

Our track record:
2022: $4,200
2023: $5,500
2024: $6,500
2025 GOAL: $7,000+

Here's something you might not know: Sojourner Center serves TEENS (13-17), and they're the most forgotten in toy drives.

So if you're shopping this season, think headphones, gift cards, hoodies—stuff teens actually want.

Drop donations at 15+ boxes across the Valley or join us Dec 6 at KannaKickback 6!

**If Video Editing Isn't Available:**
- Outsource to Fiverr editor ($50-150 for 24-hour turnaround)
- Use CapCut or InShot app (mobile editing, easier templates)
