## REGENERATION PROTOCOL

If any slides need regeneration due to text errors or quality issues:

1. **Identify Issues:**
   - Note specific text errors (spelling, missing words, wrong info)
   - Note composition problems (too dark, cluttered, poor contrast)
   - Note brand compliance issues (wrong colors, off-brand style)

2. **Modify Prompt:**
   - Emphasize problematic area (e.g., "VERY LARGE, BOLD text")
   - Add specific corrections (e.g., "Exact quote: '...'")
   - Simplify if too complex (e.g., "Minimal, clean design")

3. **Regenerate:**
   - Run script again with modified prompts for specific slides
   - Up to 3 attempts per slide before flagging for human review
   - Quality threshold: 0.80 (attempt 1), 0.70 (attempt 2), 0.60 (attempt 3)

## COORDINATOR NOTES

**Why This Worked Well:**
1. All prompts were detailed and specific (1400-2300 characters each)
2. Text was explicitly spelled out to minimize AI interpretation errors
3. Color hex codes were provided for brand consistency
4. Visual hierarchy was clearly specified (top 40%, center third, etc.)
5. Mood and style keywords aligned with brand guidelines
6. Technical specs included (1080x1080px, aspect ratio 1:1)
7. Rate limiting prevented API throttling
8. First-attempt success rate: 100% (no regenerations needed so far)

**Potential Issues to Watch:**
1. Text accuracy (especially quotes from Seren) - manual verification required
2. QR code functionality - must test scan before posting
3. Grid cell text on Slide 3 - may be small, needs readability check
4. Character consistency - KannaKlaus should match previous posts

**Recommendations:**
1. Always verify quotes word-for-word against source transcripts
2. Test all URLs and QR codes before finalizing
3. View slides on mobile device to check readability
4. Compare colors to brand guidelines document
5. Consider A/B testing Slide 1 or Slide 5 if engagement is low
