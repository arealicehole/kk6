"You've outdone corporations" 🙌

When Seren from @sojournercenters told us KannaKrew is their largest INDIVIDUAL donor... we had to sit with that for a second.

We're not a big brand. We're not a massive organization. We're just a group of friends who smoke together, throw parties together, and believe in showing up for our community.

But apparently we're doing it better than the corporations.

Year 1: $4,200 in toys
Year 2: $5,500 in toys
Year 3: $6,500 in toys
Year 4: ???

This started because someone in the Krew needed help. Sojourner Center was there for them. Now it's our turn to show up. Every. Single. Year.

💚 3 WAYS TO HELP:

1️⃣ DONATE A TOY
Drop new, unwrapped toys at 15+ donation boxes across the Valley (ages infant-17, think about the TEENS)
📍 Find locations: [link in bio]

2️⃣ COME TO KANNA KICKBACK 6
🎄 Dec 6, 2-6pm @ Ginza Restaurant, Gold Canyon
🎁 Bring a toy, get goodies, celebrate community

3️⃣ VOLUNTEER WITH SOJOURNER
They need help year-round in the Gifting Hope store, donation center, and more
🔗 Sign up: sojournercenters.org/volunteer

Let's beat $6,500. Let's show these families — especially the teens who get forgotten — that community shows up different.

All K's. No C's. Always community. 💚

### 5. Facebook Caption (Use This - Slightly Longer)

"KannaKrew has really showed up every year. You've outdone yourself, and you've actually outdone other programs that donate to us — and we have some large corporations coming in."

When Seren, the Community Engagement Manager at Sojourner Center, said those words... it hit different.

We're not a corporation. We don't have boardrooms or PR teams. We're just a group of friends who smoke together, throw parties together, and believe that community means showing up for each other.

But somehow, we've become Sojourner Center's LARGEST INDIVIDUAL DONOR.

Here's our track record:
• KannaKickback 3: $4,200 in toys
• KannaKickback 4: $5,500 in toys
• KannaKickback 5: $6,500 in toys
• KannaKickback 6: ???

This partnership started because someone in the Krew needed help. Sojourner Center was there for them. They provided shelter, safety, support — everything a survivor of domestic violence needs to rebuild their life.

Now it's our turn to be there for them. Every. Single. Year.

**Why 11:00 AM?**
- Lunch hour = peak Instagram Reels engagement
