## PRODUCTION TIMELINE

**If producing in-house:**

- Image editing/composition: 1.5 hours per card = 7.5 hours
- Text overlay design: 2-3 hours
- Revisions: 1-2 hours
- Export/upload: 30 minutes
- **TOTAL:** 14-17 hours (2 days)

**If outsourcing to designer:**
- Provide this brief + raw assets
- Request draft in 48-72 hours
- Allow 1 revision round
- Budget: $60-120 (more complex than Version A)

---

## COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

**BEFORE EXPORT - VERIFY:**
- [ ] NO cannabis leaves, joints, bongs, or smoking imagery in ANY card
- [ ] NO words: "420", "cannabis", "weed", "marijuana", "smoker's", "stoner", "lit" (slang)
- [ ] ALL people visible appear 21+ (no one looks underage)
- [ ] Party atmosphere looks fun but not excessive/irresponsible
- [ ] NO visible alcohol brand labels (generic drinks only)
- [ ] Website URL is correct and active
- [ ] All text is legible at mobile size
- [ ] Each card is exactly 1080x1080px
- [ ] All images under 30MB each
- [ ] All 5 cards look cohesive as a set
- [ ] Food photos look appetizing and professional

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**This carousel will be successful if:**
- CTR (Click-Through Rate) > 1.5% (higher than Version A)
- CPC (Cost Per Click) < $0.45 (lower than Version A)
- Swipe-through rate > 50% (users view 3+ cards)
- Engagement (likes, shares, comments) > 3% of impressions
- Positive comments mentioning "can't wait", "looks fun", "I'm there"
- Higher volume of RSVPs than Version A

**Hypothesis:**
Party-forward carousel leads with excitement and fun, attracting social/entertainment-motivated audiences. Higher swipe-through rate due to curiosity and FOMO. May generate more total RSVPs but slightly lower charity engagement (fewer toys per attendee).

---

## A/B TEST COMPARISON NOTES

**Version A (Charity) vs Version B (Party):**

| **Element** | **Version A** | **Version B** |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Card 1 Lead** | Impact number ($6,500) | Party announcement (Dec 6) |
| **Tone** | Serious, purposeful | Energetic, fun |
| **Visual Style** | Professional, warm | Bold, vibrant |
| **Food Card** | Card 4 (secondary) | Card 2 (primary) |
| **Charity Card** | Card 2 (early, detailed) | Card 5 (late, brief mention) |
| **Text Size** | Medium, elegant | Large, bold |
| **Predicted CTR** | 1.2-1.5% | 1.5-2.0% |
| **Predicted CPC** | $0.50-0.60 | $0.40-0.50 |
| **Audience Age** | 30-55 | 21-45 |

**When to Use Each:**
- **Version A:** Retargeting previous attendees, community-focused audiences, charity-aligned users
- **Version B:** Cold traffic, new audience acquisition, social/entertainment segments

---

## OPTIMIZATION NOTES

**After 2-3 Days of Running:**

**If Card 1 has low click-through:**
- Test different hook (food vs party vs date)
- Add countdown element ("5 Days Away!")

**If Swipe-through rate is low (<40%):**
- Make Card 1 more intriguing/mysterious
- Add explicit "Swipe to see the menu" CTA

**If Card 2 (food) has high drop-off:**
- Food might not be appealing enough - reshoot
- OR food appeal working but next cards less interesting - strengthen Cards 3-4

**If Overall CTR is low:**
- Primary text might be too long - test shorter variant
- CTA button might be wrong - test "RSVP" vs "Learn More"

---

## APPROVAL CHECKLIST

**Before launching campaign:**
- [ ] All 5 cards designed and reviewed
- [ ] Compliance verified (no cannabis imagery/terms)
- [ ] Party atmosphere appropriate (fun but not excessive)
- [ ] Website RSVP form tested and working
- [ ] Ginza permission obtained for venue/food photos
- [ ] All images cleared for commercial use
- [ ] Ad account has valid payment method
- [ ] Targeting set to 21+ only
- [ ] Budget allocated (portion of daily spend)
- [ ] Cards tested on mobile device (readable? high-energy?)
- [ ] Compared to Version A (distinct enough to A/B test?)

---

## SPECIAL NOTES FOR VERSION B

**Key Differentiators from Version A:**
- Lead with party/excitement, not charity stats
- Bolder, more assertive design (bigger text, brighter colors)
- Food gets premium placement (Card 2 vs Card 4)
- Charity is mentioned but downplayed ("Oh, and..." casual tone)
- More emoji use (playful, modern)
- FOMO/social proof language ("favorite party", "everyone's talking")

**Target Audience Mindset:**
- "I want to have a good time this December"
- "This looks fun, I should bring my friends"
- "I love that restaurant, and free event? I'm in"
- "Oh cool, I get to help out too? Even better"

**NOT:**
- "I want to donate to charity" (that's Version A audience)
- "I need to find a meaningful way to give back" (Version A)

---

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Gather all required photos/assets
2. Design all 5 cards according to specs
3. Export each at 1080x1080px
4. Upload to Facebook Ads Manager in correct sequence
5. Pair with Primary Ad Copy (party-forward version)
6. Set targeting (15-mile radius, 21+)
7. Launch alongside Version A for A/B testing
8. Monitor performance and optimize based on data
