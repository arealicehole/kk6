## PRODUCTION TIMELINE

**If producing in-house:**
- Asset gathering: 3-4 hours
- Video editing: 5-7 hours (more cuts/animations than Version A)
- Revisions: 1-2 hours
- Export/upload: 30 minutes
- **TOTAL:** 10-14 hours (1.5-2 days)

**If outsourcing to editor:**
- Provide this brief + all assets
- Request draft in 48-72 hours (more complex than Version A)
- Allow 1-2 revision rounds
- Budget: $75-200 depending on editor

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**This ad will be successful if:**
- CTR (Click-Through Rate) > 2.0% (higher than Version A)
- CPC (Cost Per Click) < $0.40 (lower than Version A)
- Viewer retention > 60% at 10-second mark
- Completion rate > 35%
- Higher volume of RSVPs than Version A
- Positive comments mentioning "fun", "excited", "can't wait"

**Hypothesis:**
Party-forward messaging will attract viewers looking for social/entertainment experiences, resulting in higher overall RSVP volume. May have lower cost per click and broader appeal, though RSVPs might be slightly lower quality (some people interested in party who forget about toy donation).

---

## A/B TEST COMPARISON

**Version A (Charity-Forward) vs Version B (Party-Forward):**

| **Metric** | **Version A Prediction** | **Version B Prediction** |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| CPC | $0.45-0.55 | $0.35-0.45 |
| RSVP Volume | Lower | Higher |

| Toy Donations | Higher per attendee | Medium per attendee |
| Audience Age | 30-55 (skews older) | 21-45 (skews younger) |
